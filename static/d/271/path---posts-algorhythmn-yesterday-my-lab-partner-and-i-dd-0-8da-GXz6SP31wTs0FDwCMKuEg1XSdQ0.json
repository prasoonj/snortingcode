He was working so I told him I could do the assignment alone (it was so short), and he asked me if I think I was able to do all the work. I was really offended because it was just describe an algorithm. It’s not difficult at all. :/ And when I finish the assignment and he saw it, he changed almost everything I did. Actually it was the same I wrote but he changed the words. Anyway, today we explain to the class what we had done and guess who was the only one who talked? Everytime I wanted to explain something, he interrupted me. So I barely talked. I don’t like to talk in public but today I felt very confident and that pissed me off so much.</p>\n<p>Can’t help but compare this with what happens in the industry as well. More power to women who code please!</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"no title","tags":[],"date":"2016-04-01T04:44:30+05:30","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/algorhythmn-yesterday-my-lab-partner-and-i"}}
