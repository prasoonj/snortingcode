&lt;p&gt;“I will not remove any objectionable material from any of my online &lt;strong&gt;properties&lt;/strong&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above statement came from a right-wing, online community admin of a &lt;em&gt;so-called&lt;/em&gt; gay activist a few weeks ago. The context was Section 370 and the &lt;em&gt;material&lt;/em&gt; in question was an offensive post that attempted to nullify the opinion of the people of Kashmir in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s wind the clock to a time before the 2014 general elections in India - the country was &lt;em&gt;going online&lt;/em&gt; faster than ever, WhatsApp and Facebook were beginning to capture the imagination of people at large. WhatsApp groups, Facebook pages were promising to be the paneccea of community building. This was a time before &lt;em&gt;there was an app for everything&lt;/em&gt; which meant that WA/Facebook groups were being used in very imaginative ways - there were groups that let you find accommodation in a new city, groups that let you sell old stuff (olx style), groups that enabled political discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, like several people I know, got invited to a few of these groups. These groups were nothing more than a new avatar of the earlier &lt;strong&gt;Online Forums&lt;/strong&gt; (remember the PHP powered forums of the good old days?) and the vagueness of their structure demanded a set of &lt;strong&gt;rules&lt;/strong&gt; that the communities had to follow. Because of the undemocratic nature of Facebook/WA, these were almost always top-down protocols that were deviced by the creators/admins of the group which everyone in the group had to abide by. I remember a few feuds that questioned a few of these rules but, I forget the ways in which they were resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/admin-meme.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A meme on Facebook/WhatsApp admin. Shows &quot; title=&quot;You Got The Admin Power Babe!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, encouraged by the disenfranchising DNA of these groups, we saw the emergence of, what we can call, the &lt;strong&gt;Admin Meme&lt;/strong&gt;! These were memes that glorified (or attacked, often in jest) the group admins. For those of us who administered a few of these groups, the message was clear - we had a certain power over a group of people who had willingly submitted to the hierarchy established by these platforms. Along with a few others, I was the admin of a &lt;em&gt;Queer Confessions&lt;/em&gt; group and I realized that it was no longer necessary for me to be funny, witty or even make any sense at all - my posts would be appreciated by a majority since they carried the extra weight of this fiat authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/leaked-documents-show-brazil-bolsonaro-has-grave-plans-for-amazon-rainforest/&quot;&gt;A lot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/19/why-does-donald-trump-want-to-buy-greenland&quot;&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scroll.in/article/721065/from-loving-his-german-shepherd-to-2ab-did-prime-minister-modi-really-say-that&quot;&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; since 2014! We live in a different world, a world that is on the brink of destruction! In this new era public opinion is manufactured in content farms, fake news seems more legit than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ6z26yPBV4&quot;&gt;news from traditional media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnoLAMHwf2I&quot;&gt;people don’t seem to care&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;em&gt;new age&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;coughs&lt;/strong&gt;) your membership to these online communities is bought and sold in the information/data market! Here’s how this works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;em&gt;seemingly benign&lt;/em&gt; community on WA/FB. Let’s call it &lt;em&gt;“Sexy women of Bollywood”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add people to the group indiscriminately. (If you are in countries like India where privacy laws are virtually non-existant, you could spam as many people as you like and add them to these groups without taking their consent first! In other places like the USA the &lt;strong&gt;CAN SPAM&lt;/strong&gt; act allows you to &lt;em&gt;spam everyone atleast once&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep sharing content that numbs the brain and encourages more mindless participation from unsuspecting members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait for the right bidder to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; this *&lt;strong&gt;*PROPERTY**&lt;/strong&gt; to for the highest price!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the community is &lt;em&gt;sold&lt;/em&gt;, the more seasoned manipulators take over and quickly turn it into a toxic sludge of hateful propaganda! Often the bots overwhelm the communities and play on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;group think&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make people believe in ridiculous BS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How does one escape this muck?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the answer might not surprise you, just &lt;strong&gt;fucking&lt;/strong&gt; quit Facebook, severely limit WhatsApp and adop more democratic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/open-source-alternatives-for-everyone/&quot;&gt;open source alternatives&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rediscovering India]]></title><description><![CDATA[Who is more powerful - the protagonist or the storyteller? This is me trying to stay optimistic in times of a major socio-political crisis of the world!]]></description><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/rediscovering-india/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/rediscovering-india/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Elections in India started a couple of weeks ago. Elections on the other side of the world are not so far away. Over the years, despite the insistence on the superiority of its ancient cultural heritage, India has caulously tried to mimic USA. India’s financial systems, public survelance misadventures, corporate monopoly tactics, cultural and socio-economic policies have increasingly walked the line dictated by direct economic influence and a well oiled propaganda machinary that has been increasing its efficacy in consent manufacturing over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election of Modi in India was celebrated by Trump supporters in USA in 2014 and when Trump managed to stunn the world by winning the presidential race in the US, his victory horns were heard in the saffron streets of Indian cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these election results were clear about one thing - people wanted a radical change in the world affairs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have things changed post Modi/Trump?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying that the world has changed drastically in the last few years, post those dramatic election results, for better or worse! There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/politics/policy/manmohan-singh-vs-narendra-modi-the-real-india-gdp-growth-story-1555034270688.html&quot;&gt;several takes&lt;/a&gt; on this and I would let you run with the one that best suits you. While the Modi government, for instance, says that it has done what it promised, the election messaging has remained the same. There has been a flood of battle tested campaign strategies delivering modified slogals that appear to be infusing the same drug into the election fervor under a different name. In India, for instance, the opposition is still the only impediment that the incumbant government pins all miseries of the population on; at times even digging out people like Nehru from the grave, carving monsters of convienience out of the defenseless dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite possible that the leaders are as clueless about the sources and solutions of the problems that plague their countries, as the people who elected them. It would be unwise of anyone to suggest that they carry evil intentions and even if they do, Socratic wisdom reminds us that after all, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ignorance is the source of all evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You might still be the boss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that on the surface, both these states still look largely democratic. There are systemic disenfranchisement issues for several sections of the society but, the elections, on the whole, are not openly rigged. People still have the power, even if all it amounts to is certifying the con man who managed to fool them the best with their valuable vote. The fact that political setups need to spend money and effort in public propaganda is a sign of a functioning democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seemingly infallible leaders may look like the protagonists or the antagonists of the political tales but, the story teller is still YOU, the average voter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, how and where we go from here is in your hands. Yogendra Yadav, a respected political analyist and a fairly recent political leader from India, recently talked about how this election would decide ”&lt;em&gt;if India would remain India or not&lt;/em&gt;”. Those are strong words if one introspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The nature of change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People want change, that much is certain. What would that change look like? Who is capable of understanding the necessicity of that change? Who has the ability to deliver it? There are several questions that India and USA would attempt to answer in the coming months. I have observed that more often than not, change is inevitable and it comes unannounced and uninvited. The peddlers of change are often just selling us status quo disguised as change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent example would be the Obama administration which did not change the economic exploitation by the rich, did not change the status of US funded war in several parts of the world, did not change the shameful bullying of the copyright lobby. A more extreme example would be Hitler himself who tried to take the world several years behind in terms of inclusiveness, tolerance and peace. The ones who sell dreams of a perfect future are often trapped in an imaginary reverie of the past. The pragmatic always prepare for an unseen future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of Modi in India is yet another example of status quo masquarading as socio-political change: the corruption is the same, economy is in a slumber, education in shambles. There is a lot of talk about the future with a promise that it would look exactly like the “glorious past”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such salespersons happen to have it easy since their audience is as afraid of change as they are! Their supporters stay immobile, captivated by the hypnotic chanting in their mind, that shuts down all discourse of a future that ought to look considerably different from what their current frame of reference would allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion (of sorts)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what would India vote for? A future full of beautiful uncertainities or a cry for a faded glory? If one employs a modicum of thought to the idea of a “glorious past”, one would easily arrive at a fairly honest picture of what that glory looked like and who did it belong to. The past is paved with individual glories, enourmous monuments constructed on the bloodied backs of a repressed class, caste based discrimination. This idea of glory and past appeals to those who continue to hold on to power that would be diluted if more democratic leaders replace those who wish to dismantle the power of the will of the people. You, as the story teller, would eventually decide the future. You could break the chains of the past or continue to romanticise a leadership that wishes to plunge the country into a backward direction, while entertaining you with dreams of a future that it is incapable of delivering due to its admiration of an imagined past!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Open Source For Everyone]]></title><description><![CDATA[Did you know that there are great Open Source alternatives for almost every service you use on the Internet?

To give you an idea about the power and influence of Open Source in our lives, let me give you a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft paid &lt;strong&gt;7.5 billion dollors&lt;/strong&gt; for GitHub, the most popular platform for managing Open Source code on the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you eliminated Open Source software in its entirety, you would not have any information/communication that’s operational. The whole world would break down. There is no other entity that can make such a claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If every Open Source developer was paid $1 for every piece of code that they check in ($1 per commit) and that money was given away, we would end poverty in the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see the day when &lt;strong&gt;Open Source software for governance&lt;/strong&gt; would become an election winning agenda in a powerful country of the world. Open Source governance software framework could completely change the way nations are thought about and governed. Imagine a 14 year old from Malaysia checking in code into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;human-rights&lt;/code&gt; repository of Netherlands which gets approved by the body of core committers and becomes part of the way people in Europe interact! The idea of the Government as the most powerful goon, that has never been contested even in a (mostly) functional democracy, could be replaced by a Government that would not just have &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; as a goal but, as a fundamental truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the governments of the world take their time to come to terms with the power of Open Source, here are some alternatives for your everyday Internet shenanigans from the world of Open Source (or as you would discover for youself soon - the world of &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt; and beauty):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gmail/Yahoo&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://disroot.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disroot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceBook&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://diasporafoundation.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diaspora&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastodon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skype&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jitsi Meet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these come with pretty much the same functionality as their blood sucking cousin but, they give you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompromisable privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolute control over your own data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No hidden cost (that you pay with your soul or manipulation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The primary attraction of Mcleodganj is the buddhist monastry that attracts thousands of people each year. In the freezing fag-end of winters, His Holiness The Dalai Lama visits the town to impart bhuddhist teachings which transforms this tiny town into a gushing river of devotees and curious people like me. This late February event also marks the beginning of the &lt;em&gt;tourist season&lt;/em&gt;. The hibernating vibrance of the town springs out of the colorful shops near the main square, local businesses invoke their Gods as they begin to welcome the tourists from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average foreign tourist begins their &lt;strong&gt;Great Indian Adventure&lt;/strong&gt; typically in New Delhi, the Indian capital and, a sizable chunk make their way to the mountains, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand providing a window into the Indian culture and way of life; a gentle and peaceful introduction to India. It is common for these tourists to share their share of &lt;em&gt;horror stories&lt;/em&gt; from Delhi. Even just a few hours are enough to shock them into a reality that few would understand from a Bollywood blockbuster. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is There A Future For Us?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Is Climate Change really such a big threat?

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being puzzled by something that seems obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempting to control it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaining a deeper understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a couple of examples to show you what I mean. We could begin with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/code&gt;! It is safe to assume that our species saw wild fire and unlike other animals didn’t just get afraid and run away, they probably stayed around the billowing jungle fire that was engulfing their homes to take notes. Then they began to experiment with it to see if they could control it - they would see that they could make it bigger or contain it, they would see that they could take it with them! Then must have begun the age of a deeper understanding (we never really grow out of that last phase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take another example - electricity! The observational wealth of knowldege around electricity (and magnetisim!) dates back to at least the ancient greeks. The first published work by William Gilbert in the 1600 happens to be a giant catalog of this knowlege about electricity up till that time. Then comes along Benjamin Franklin and puts a noose around this wild, untamable natural phenomenon and &lt;em&gt;keys into the thunderstorm&lt;/em&gt; for some &lt;em&gt;run o’the mill electricity&lt;/em&gt;. He also talks about the ability to &lt;em&gt;store&lt;/em&gt; electricity. That’s when we start controlling electricity. Maxwell then becomes the person to initiate the &lt;strong&gt;deeper understanding&lt;/strong&gt; phase of electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the success formula for millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observe =&gt; Control =&gt; Understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, every once in a while, we reach a stage where tried and tested methodologies fail. Not because the methodology has fallacies but simply because the nature of the problem is remarkably different from what we’ve been dealing with so far. I hope to present one such problem in this post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the most pressing issue of our times. Something that the world’s consciousness has never faced before - end of organised life on earth because of climate change. The world is facing a crisis at the moment which is much bigger than any other issue being discussed in popular forums across the planet. We’ve been misbehaving with the environment of this planet and it is starting to show alarming signs of it choaking at an unpresidented rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the response that us, earth dwellers and, the only culprits have been able to collectively muster so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate Change denial is &lt;strong&gt;still a thing!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no agreement on the deadlines set by the IPCC by the most powerful/capable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s renewable energy talk without the required quanta of action and policies in most places on the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a rather big camp of the &lt;strong&gt;“we’ve always survived catastrophic events in the past”&lt;/strong&gt; people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equally alarming size of the &lt;strong&gt;“God is taking revenge for Gay marriages”&lt;/strong&gt; people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A rather tiny but significant camp of the super rich who are, honestly, too old now to give a shit about you and I having a &lt;em&gt;bad weather&lt;/em&gt; (to be read in the voice of one of the greatest philanthropist of our times - Bill Gates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation in the response department is, as if, we are hoping to find a way to &lt;strong&gt;control the environment&lt;/strong&gt; by inventing a gadget in a Silicon Valley garage (invested in and marketed by your friendly, neighbourhood venture capitalist. The company tagline - &lt;em&gt;“Give us your money and you’ll still be breathing in our digital closet long after the earth is smoked out!”&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, this particular problem does not fit our age old &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Observe =&amp;gt; Control =&amp;gt; Understand&lt;/code&gt; paradigm. This one here is a candidate for a different problem solving approach. We need to gain better understanding before we can attempt to control it. And this is such a complex beast that developing an understanding could take a while. Possibly even longer than the T0 (assimilation into the Singularity event!) And till that time comes, we need to appreciate what we have and hold on to it for at least a little longer. We can’t just blow up this earth and venture out into the space looking for other places to build a home, inspite of what Hollywood and Elon Musk might have you believe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in closing and, to answer the question about some smart science grad student “solving” climate change in the near future, I must tell you that they have solutions that could work just no magic wand as yet!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Do the right thing!]]></title><description><![CDATA[Did you know that social media is designed to be addictive? And just like any other addiction, social media also cripples your brain.]]></description><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/quit-social-media-already-please</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/quit-social-media-already-please</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 22:11:30 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent countless wasteful hours on content that “provides motivation” to do the right thing. Spiritual gurus, sports psychologists, industry leaders, youtube philosophers thrown into the mix, churned into a goop of indistinguishable spaghetti of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I can talk about that waste, I must qualify what “the right thing” to do might be. I believe that everyone has a perfectly tuned, innate moral compass that does not require any political, legal or religious frame of reference to decide the best investment of their time. Then, as we come across different power structures and our place within them, we draw arbitrary lines of moral code of conduct for ourselves. The arbitrariness of these lines that “should never be crossed” is evident in the fact that when we are dealing with ‘the other’, the topology of this moral navigation changes considerably! In fact, even for our own self, these moral high-grounds provide an opportunistically shifting grazing, often under the charming deception of the tutelage provided by the authority figures who we look up to for inspiration and moral conduct. So, while it might be difficult to articulate what it is, one always knows what the right course of action must be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly trapped in a myriad of unescapable, spiralling, perpetual miseries. One such spiral is comfort. Feed comfort and it expands its appetite till you end up dead from the burden of the curse of the task of maximising the comfort in your life. Sit in a chair for an hour and your body would scream when you touch the floor. For most of us, a descent from higher moral standards is more comfortable than the climb for reasons that are so human in their origin that they can’t be negated by lectures in courage and motivation, whatever the framework and medium of delivery might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve considered myself a social media addict for a long time now, even though my consumption/participation has been well below the average lately, I believe. I can only imagine the hardships that are upon other sufferers. Take an online test to know where you are in your addiction. Then there are other impacts of making a deal with the devil when we use these platforms for free. The debate about Facebook using our data to manipulate our social, economic and political consent happening on Facebook is as laughable and ineffective as therapy for alcohol addiction served along with a gin and tonic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I’ve wanted to control my urge to be on social media platforms for a while now. While blanket motivation or spiritual initiation might work for others, they don’t really work very well for me. I’m replacing those with some good old overdose of rational thought. I came across an advertisement for a “Survey for cash”-esque mobile phone app called “Applause” which claims to be “Crowdsourced Software Testing Platform” and the fine print for this particular project reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Since he is seen as a symbol of strength in the Indian political system, this statement is also perceived as one that symbolises the unshakable strength that people think is a prime requirement for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think about unflinching value systems? Are you a weak person if your value system underwent a repair? I vaguely remember a similar conversation with a friend who was asking me about my value system a few months ago and was not quite convinced when I told him that I don’t have a rigid set of values. An explanation is due!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we understand things better by analogy, I would start with a few of those and then talk about some concrete way to look at the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ido Portal, the genius behind the movement culture, talks about the importance of building, what he calls, ‘bamboo legs’. His idea of strong legs is not the ones we see on the tele, lifting the equivalent of the indian parliament for squats, shaped like the trunk of an oak tree. Strength, he says, is about being able to be flexible. Flexible, bamboo like legs can perform much better under pressure. Flexibility seems to be a key element of physical strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we talk about the mind, one of the primary drivers for us is the need to be able to understand new surroundings and environments, as quickly as possible. The best brains belong to those who can change their perception of reality rapidly as new information flows in. That’s the central idea of Bayesian statistics - how does your understanding about reality improve when new information is provided to you. Our brains are bayesian networks, as far as we know. Taking pride in not being able to change your primary drivers, your value system, when new information is provided, might act as a great political move but, is very poor strategy to live ones life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best philosophies for the question - “How should I live my life?” - comes from stoicism. I say it comes from stoicism because it is a somewhat formal treatment of the matter and several religions have adopted similar strategies. The analogy there is that you need to nurture your value systems, ethical standpoint with your understanding of ‘physics’ (understanding of the nature). As you discover new facts about the world, your ethical framework would adapt to this new understanding of reality. Life, therefore, has to be a constant process of improvement that this feedback enables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, our interaction with the world is largely dependent on the frameworks we use to interpret it. If your framework happens to be a religious one, you might tackle a question like “why does meditation feel so good” based on religious texts, anecdotes, traditions and rituals. If your framework of analysis is neuroscience, you might talk about how meditation decreases activity in the default mode network of our brain. While both these people would agree on the end goal, their explanation would differ in a grand manner. “Who is right?”, the question is absurd till we find a common language to talk about them. It is important, then, to find common grounds to be able to talk about a phenomenon that these different sets of people have observed even if they disagree in their explanation. This common ground - an isomorphism between the two systems - provides the grand unification of the two systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that strength comes from being ‘smart’. Our brain is our biggest asset. We clearly are not as strong as even our pets at home. Especially in political debates, when one talks about strength, they are talking about mental strength (although sharing pictures of Yoga or martial art practice sessions as a symbol of strength is becoming a norm these days). Mental strength is less about being a stubborn person who would never learn new information and more about building clever bridges across different value systems so that reality can be perceived in different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For PM Modi, this might mean developing the child like ability to be honest about his failures, humble about his victories and a deep sense of curiosity for things that may lie outside of the ethos of the sangh.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[If You Wish To Save Humanity, Shut Down All Schools!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/shut-down-the-schools</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/shut-down-the-schools</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 May 2018 22:11:30 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning is such an innate quality, a natural skill, that each one of us knows how to learn about the world around us. Kids are engineered to absorb the knowledge about the world around them. They do it so innately that we’ve spent billions of dollars in trying to understand how they are capable of such a feat, in neuroscience labs and are only beginning to scratch the surface of that mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, driven by our arrogance, us grownups have, for centuries, believed that we have “lessons” to impart to kids. That our “methodology”, “pedagogy” is one that would work for generations of kids in teaching them things about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This arrogance is incapable of teaching anything! In fact, in most cases this is so caustic that it manages to motivate children to stop learning. These authority institutions that we encounter in the early years of our kids switch-off the natural ability of human beings to learn about their environment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What do we teach in schools?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with busting some myths about the “important subjects” - languages and mathematics. The truth is that kids have an innate language ability. We don’t need to teach them language. In fact, they are the ones who “invent” new languages. The ability to associate arbitrary written symbols to spoken words does need to be taught. The fact that most teachers involved in teaching language to young kids are oblivious of the innate language ability of kids, says a lot about how terrible the state of affairs is in that department. These teachers mistake arbitrary words and phrase constructions for the word of God. This is what the kids run into when they enter a school - grammar rules! Things couldn’t be worse! Since access to important information is often restricted by the ability to acquire reading and writing skills, these teachers, at an early stage, do something that shuts the doors of learning for most kids since they themselves have been living under a rock! (If this seems like incorrect information, I would encourage you to do some research on language acquisition. Steven Pinker’s “The Language Instinct” is a great resource, there are a ton of videos on YouTube as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematics, several people believe, is in our brain, just like language. The way it is taught is not just bad but often, incorrect! Memorising multiplication tables, memorising arbitrary formulae and rules to transform them into one another, memorising “concepts” without an explanation of the underlying theme. Mathematics is a language that is used to model the world. Newton invented calculus when he was trying to model gravity and not just as an abstract set of formulae and rules. Learning math is more about learning about the world around us than we usually think. There is more math to be learned in a playground than in a class with an unmotivated teacher which is usually the case in most schools. There is some interesting research that is discovering the use of musical training to help in imagining advanced concepts like topology. Sadly, that pedagogy lives only in fringes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only things we are successful in teaching most kids in a school setting is discipline! How to respect authority, especially an irrational, unjust authority! In fact, most teachers I have spoken to think that this is an essential skill to have. Discipline, they feel is what keeps the world running. This fascination for order and control is fast fading. There is less and less trust in authoritative agencies of the world and things would only move towards more freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What might be the solution?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is a blogpost! Don’t expect this to include a well-designed, flawless framework of this new system of education (or the wonders of the absence of it). That said, I can provide a way to imagine what such a system could be like. These days, when I’m given the responsibility to mentor a team member, the first question I ask is their preferred mode of learning. When I joined the IT industry, if you wanted to learn a new technology, you bought a book! These days, there are several amazing resources that do not come in the form of a physical book. Increasingly, I’ve come across young people who prefer a video lecture over reading a book. Several complex concepts become very easy to comprehend when a visualisation is used as an aid. The education industry is disrupting, with such innovative solutions becoming a part of our reality. Innovative learning that works at a fraction of the cost of the traditional education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer learning online communities are another great example of how the landscape is changing faster than can be imagined within the framework of the traditional education system. In effect, there needs to be an open sharing of research fuelled by community created content that makes that research available to people at large.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design Harmony]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/design-harmony</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/design-harmony</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2018 18:11:30 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you visit Prague and decide to explore the city during the day, your attention would swing back and forth between the beautiful people on the streets and the beautiful monuments and statues that dot the entirety of that enchanting city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alloy statues all across the city have a curious property - they all have glistening privates! As bizarre as this sounds, it takes only a moment to understand why. Visitors to the city, over the years, have consistently placed their hands on the genitalia of these structures, rendering those parts gleamingly distinguishable from the rest of the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certainly adds a character to the original structures that imparts quite a unique interaction quality to them. I think we can safely assume that this interaction with the art was not “by design” yet, it emerged as a very powerful feature that increases the efficacy of the structure if we assume that its function is to engage visitors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such serendipitous interactions are miraculous. If you are in the business of designing interactions for your customers, these are the holy grail of design to an extent. The question of interest then, would be to see if such interactions can be conceived in advance, implemented with foresight and tested before the actual rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a great biologist from the early 20th century, D’Arcy Thompson, who devoted considerable energy into exploring such “causes”. Especially, the synergy that exists between &lt;em&gt;“final cause”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“physical cause”&lt;/em&gt;. Final cause is the cause based on purpose - a wheel has a round shape by design because other shapes would make locomotion impractical. Physical cause is the inherent nature/feature of the object under consideration - a pebble has a smooth surface because its edges have been chipped away by corrosion over several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think good design is all about finding a natural synergy between the final cause and the physical cause. This is true for all disciplines; anywhere design considerations are important. The most obvious would be interaction design. The interaction designer who gets my money would be able to find that synergy between a desired interaction of the end-user with the product and the mechanical structure of the product - various moving parts, etc. An example that would be easier to understand would be designing an algorithm that has mechanical sympathy - something as simple as having bigger block sizes in a file system that crunches BigData.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could offer a formula that could be applied to different situations. I have none. However, design thought can transcend formulae to an extent. Think of it as a NP-Complete problem that is hard to find the solution to but, once you guess a good solution, it is easy to test things out!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why I moved to Jekyll (OR Why I dislike Tumblr)]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/why-i-moved-to-jekyll-or-dislike-tumblr</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/why-i-moved-to-jekyll-or-dislike-tumblr</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 18:11:30 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR; Writing on Tumblr is slow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in love with the content I consume on Tumblr. I think it’s quirky, imaginative and delicious. Tumblr has been able to create a niche for itself in the several content areas and I would rather spend my time on Tumblr than say, Facebook (the dark underbelly of Tumblr is quite exciting as well!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I don’t enjoy composing my posts on Tumblr. It is a slow and painful process, even when I use the markdown editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Here’s what I would have liked to have on Tumblr:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto save! I’ve lost some work once in a while because Tumblr does not save what you write automatically. Switching from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; mode to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt; mode is just insane!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Preview&lt;/em&gt; is a lot of times very different from what I finally see on the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better way to search my posts and organise them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to create a collection of posts on a topic. Think of this as a “Series”. I don’t have a direct way of doing this on Jekyll either but, it is a lot faster to update multiple posts on my editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things I love about Jekyll&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use my own editor! Atom works very well with markdown templates and I know the shortcuts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can preview on localhost. This is just incredible faster, especially when you are writing something that has a lot of different types of content - code blocks, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More creative control over the look and feel of my blog (although, this is just initial excitement. I’m yet to change anytime in this template I picked up from Github)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting at Github is wonderful! There might be some scale issues but hey, this is not a mission critical application!&lt;/li&gt;

Essentially, Facebook would need a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;verification&lt;/code&gt; endpoint on your webserver to verify your webhook after which it would post the messages that you subscribe to. If you are using Lagom’s ( &lt;em&gt;almost magical&lt;/em&gt; ) webservices framework, you might want to start with this &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;giter8&lt;/code&gt; template to &lt;a href=&quot;url:https://github.com/prasoonj/lagom-fbmessenger-webhook.g8&quot;&gt;get a working webhook out of the box&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Move on!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/upset-about-facebook-data-scandal-move-on</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/upset-about-facebook-data-scandal-move-on</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 18:11:30 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The point we’re all missing with the Facebook data leaks and no one really wants to talk about is something that invalidates Facebook’s source of income and your purpose on this “social networking” website!If Facebook is a platform for “friends” why are the political parties, big corporations, businesses even on it? A platform for friends is bound to be personal. One would expect it to have access to some very intimate details that can be used in any form of manipulation if one intends to do that. A Trump election campaign is not my “friend”. I might really be expecting Narendra Modi to change India into a country that has gold plated roads and convert each citizen into a swatch Bharat candidate whose fart smells of raspberries but, Modi is not my “friend”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These organisations have one agenda when they join Facebook - mass manipulation! If we express shock at the ways in which they’ve abused Facebook’s loosely defined data protection policies, we are merely engaging in self-deception. This platform is doing exactly what it is meant to do - provide access to your personal information to agencies that intend to use it to manufacture consent. Each new feature that’s added to the platform has just one function - increase user engagement to the point that you are so addicted that you take stupid decisions. I thought it was quite clear that this “free” platform was a trap. Honestly, I’m just surprised that people thought otherwise. If you “Like” a page titled “Trump for President”, you are engaging in active propaganda. Compare any of your friends’ Facebook posts with that of your favourite politician - does it ever look like you are looking at the daily activities of another human being? Do they even ever poop?! Or have sex, get drunk, have a crapy hangover, sound stupid and express gratitude when you correct them?These are NOT YOUR FRIENDS! When you sign up to follow these personalities and corporations, you are signing a consent form to be ready to be manipulated! So, take responsibility for your stupidity and move on!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Let’s Settle The Technology Debate?!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/lets-settle-the-technology-debate</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/lets-settle-the-technology-debate</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2018 00:50:58 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Let me begin with a disclaimer: I’ve bet my career on Technology so, what I have to say about it is certainly influenced by a confirmation bias.I came across a Facebook post by a friend, that talked about a Robot Chef - one can download recipes over the Internet and, have this giant pair of robotic arms prepare food for them. Seeing it in motion was a delight for me, others did not share the same feeling. There were essentially 2 common themes in the concerns expressed in the comment section:This is going to kill the employment that my “maid” currently has - cooking meals for me and my family (Low skilled labor in India is very cheap so the richer people often have maids. Yes, this is India’s post-colonial irony!).
This would suck the joy out of a creative activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could apply similar arguments to any domain where automation is taking baby steps. Let’s talk about them one at a time.Employment in the age of automationYes, irrespective of what your friendly, neighbourhood entrepreneur tells you, automation IS eating into the employment scene. There are going to be fewer jobs around and currently held skill sets would become redundantly undesirable, irrelevant. This is already happening in areas where automation has gone beyond the “baby steps”, although, this is nothing new!There are 2 solutions that come to my mind (killing new technology is not a solution and, it would require nothing short of a world war followed by a frozen nuclear winter to do that - I don’t recommend doing that although your favourite world leader might urge you to support that idea):Explore and create new skill sets: Remember that “maid” that you are concerned about? Start investing in their future, urge them to take up evening classes to learn whatever they are capable of learning - soft skills, a new language (English in India is a sought after skill), elementary coding skills if they have some basic education.Make sure that you are paying them enough so that they can create “post-retirement” means of living for themselves. Help them with investments and future planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urge your governments to increase spending on things that matter -&gt; health and education: If you live in a country where education and healthcare is not a fundamental right of every citizen, there’s something broken about your country! Vote to repair that scheme of things. A minimum basic income scheme is also something that governments should start to explore actively!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology = End of creativityAsk any techie you know and they would tell you otherwise! But, I blame the tech world for this misconception. People think that technology is not a creative endeavour, possibly because tech sits on top of some ivory tower which reduces their customers to a UUID.randomUUID(). The tech world has largely failed to educate their users about the technology they use on a regular basis. We don’t have to be in this ignorant state! The technology we create doesn’t need to be “dumbed down” but, we need to stop thinking of our users as “dumb users” (I’ve heard that phrase a number of times in UX design discussions).For the non-techies reading this article, well, just because we use tools that most of you don’t have much experience with, does not really make us less creative. Imagine telling a violinist that they are not in a creative profession because true creativity is just vocalisation of ragas! In fact, the artists producing electronic sounds are facing similar questions around their work. (Don’t) watch this video that trivialises Alt-j’s music and you’ll understand my point better (they have over 8 million views!) I’m certain they won’t say the same thing about a vocalist!.This is insane! If you think that technology is not a creative activity/profession, try surrounding yourself with all the failed tech products that you can think of, for a day, here’s a list you can begin with: Windows 7, Orkut, Windows Vista, Zune (not many companies have the money to market failed products hence that list is heavy with Microsoft). In fact, creativity is the litmus test for a tech product! When we hire employees to build the next generation technology, we prefer people who can exhibit creative thinking ahead of any other skill that they might posses. The reason for that is simple, we don’t want to copy existing products, we want to build things that don’t exist yet. Imagining such products is impossible without creativity! Yes, the robotic companies are “just copying” basic human capabilities but, with that reductionist argument, Da Vinci was just copying some woman sitting on a chair!Final wordIf there’s one thing I want to convince you with this article, it is this: Whichever side of the fence you are on in this technology debate, you need to know what’s going on on the other side! If you are creating technology, you need to be able to effectively address these fears that your future customers might have.If you are a user (and you are! There’s no escape, the matrix has you :D ), engage with technology the way you engage with your local politician. If you think that things are broken, educate yourself enough to be able to dig out email IDs of people who make these tech products and write to them! They owe you an explanation!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cooking yummy Functional code - (partial, curry, compose)!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/cooking-yummy-functional-code-partial-curry</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/cooking-yummy-functional-code-partial-curry</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 00:00:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;[This is part of a series of posts on Scala and Functional Programming:

&lt;p&gt;Part 3: Cooking yummy Functional code - (partial, curry, compose)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a basic introduction to Scala, syntax, etc. you can check out Scala Fast Lane
]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t intend to turn this post into a click-bait article but, I find these 3 Functional Programming principles to be fundamental to understanding FP it well. Without them, you would write imperative code in your favorite functional programming language!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would notice that they weave into each other and produce some rather beautiful imagery about FP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partial Functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with Partial functions. The idea is neat, if you have a function that takes several arguments, you can convert it into a function that that takes fewer arguments. You produce this magic by creating a function that fills-in the rest of the argument values and returning the same function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example below, we’ll take a function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;f: (A, B) =&amp;gt; C&lt;/code&gt; (takes 2 arguments of types A and B and returns a type C) and convert it into a partial function that takes the value for the first argument and returns a function that just needs the second argument to produce the C that you needed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scala&amp;gt; def partial[A,B,C](a: A, f: (A,B) =&amp;gt; C): B =&amp;gt; C = (b:B) =&amp;gt; f(a, b)
partial: [A, B, C](a: A, f: (A, B) =&amp;gt; C)B =&amp;gt; C&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[If the parameterised type signature looks scary to you, you should read more about it and come back here. It is there for a reason. It emphasises the need for functions like these!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s look at currying. A (rather silly) analogy to understand currying is to think of yourself as an indian housewife making a great indian curry for your family in the evening! The number of ingredients that you would need can be intimidating so there are 2 things you do -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine few ingredients together so that they are easier to handle (the typical off-the-shelf sambar poweder!).
Add them one after the other till you get the curry your family loves!
Currying converts a function that takes N arguments into a function that takes one argument. This new function returns another function. If we go back to our analogy, each ‘step’ in this currying process is a function application that takes you closer to your goal - the yummy result of a function that needs a ton of arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scala&amp;gt; def curry[A,B,C](f: (A, B) =&amp;gt; C): A =&amp;gt; (B =&amp;gt; C) = (a: A) =&amp;gt; (b: B) =&amp;gt; f(a, b)
curry: [A, B, C](f: (A, B) =&amp;gt; C)A =&amp;gt; (B =&amp;gt; C)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to confuse currying and partial functions. Here’s some insight that might help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the type signatures of the two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;partial: [A, B, C](a: A, f: (A, B) =&amp;gt; C)B =&amp;gt; C&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curry: [A, B, C](f: (A, B) =&amp;gt; C)A =&amp;gt; (B =&amp;gt; C)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In partial, you are “applying” one of the arguments so the returned function is free of A. Its job is done! But, in curry, you get a function that needs just one of the arguments and passes the buck to the function that it then returns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a partial application as “forgetful” and currying as, well, like I said, the curry recipe will always be able to tell you how you reached there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Function Composition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece of the puzzle here is function composition. Well, TBH, I’m rather certain that you are already quite familiar with function composition so, I’ll include it here just for completeness (in some shallow sense :D )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only analogy you need here is the idea of pipes from your terminal/shell! You “pipe” the output of one function as input to another function and you have function composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scala&amp;gt; def compose[A, B, C](f: B =&amp;gt; C, g: A =&amp;gt; B): A =&amp;gt; C = (a: A) =&amp;gt; f(g(a))
compose: [A, B, C](f: B =&amp;gt; C, g: A =&amp;gt; B)A =&amp;gt; C&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same as: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;g compose f or f andThen g&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;compose&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;andThen&lt;/code&gt; are utility functions provided by scala, which might make you notice that we did not use any magic function to explain what partial and curry were all about! Well, the magic of FP is probably hidden in the fact that there is no magic. We could use the elementary idea of higher order functions and build everything from there!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are you interested?]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/are-you-interested</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/are-you-interested</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2018 23:57:02 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Salespersons ruin everything! Adding to their long list of spoils is the phrase “Are you interested?”. If you’ve ever had a person call you about a bank loan, credit card or a new insurance policy, you know what I’m talking about. I remember when the phrase “Are you interested?” was used to express deep, emotional relationships. “I’m in love with you. Are you interested in me?”, “We are going for a trek next Sunday, are you interested?”There was a purpose about that phrase. Being interested in something was just that - being genuinely interested in it. Now, thanks to the cold calling of salespersons (and that “Interested” button on Facebook events), it is just an euphemism for “Have I got your attention?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, those two are very different things. A dog wagging his tail gets my attention almost always! That does not mean that I’m ready for a commitment, a relationship with him no matter how cute I find him (and dogs, truly are awesome!)“Have I got your attention”, to most people, feels too superficial for some reason.I recently connected 2 of my contacts over a phone call for a business venture. My motive to get this relationship going was to have the pleasure of seeing a business flourish, observe how small businesses interact with their customers and, use that learning for my own startup. The response after this introduction was - “Yes, I’m interested!” (possibly without the “!”). I was quite happy with my efforts, hoping to make a difference in someone’s life when I heard that. If they are interested, they would make things work! However, this turned out to be one of those “You’ve got my attention” cases. Fizzled out in a few days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here’s what I do: If I’m interested, I make an effort to get things rolling. I call, message, reach out, talk, break walls, build bridges. If I’m not, I say, “Sorry, that does not interest me” and I stop right there. If an idea is not interesting enough to be worth a dream, I don’t keep it dangling in my brain. There are always much better things to look forward to. I’m not a great judge of ideas TBH. I’ve missed out on a lot of great opportunities that would have been great ventures I’m sure. But, I don’t think I remember many that I chased with all my energy and was disappointed about my effort. That for me is something I would live with - an honest effort or an honest denial.The most crucial thing to learn for me right now is to identify people who mean it when they say, “I’m interested!”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Competition, Insecurity and Scientific Method]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/competition-insecurity-and-scientific-method</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/competition-insecurity-and-scientific-method</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 20:26:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed a pattern lately. At the risk of over-fitting, let me share what I think, so I can learn from your experiences as well.Competition has been showcased as the cornerstone of human progress. “We are getting better every day because we compete with each other”, has become the golden mantra that guides policy making, relationships at work, even family ties at times! I don’t want to go into how this idea has been used to justify unfair business practices, justify neoliberal economic policies (with a completely circular argument!), ignore the privileges that govern so much of our lives and ultimately gives rise to a false notion of “free will”!I wish to talk about something more insidious. Possibly, even try and make sense of why the world seems broken, why relationships seem fake and why it is so difficult to find true love!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that competition is a facade. The real evil is a deep sense of insecurity that goes unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding behind this facade are all sorts of unsorted issues that, over the years, shape into a complex entangled mess of falsehoods which can be impossible to get rid of without a focused effort.Let’s start with some personality traits. A typical insecure person described by your psychology textbook would be someone with a “lack of confidence”, “lack of protection” which is what it most certainly is. However, people have deception as a survival skill. We won that fight with the gang of wolves because we could convince them that we were stronger! We practice deception from an early age. The way animals engage in a “fight-play” routine, we hone our deception skills. Over the years, we get really good at it. We acquire such excellent deception skills that we are able to deceive ourselves! Insecurity is often not dealt with inspection/introspection, it is given a lethal dose of deception. Such insecure people exhibit high confidence, a fake sense of superiority and an attitude that gives them “that edge” that’s so palpable in company boardrooms. They are the ones that “get things done” (but, they never do these things! They don’t know how to!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such insecure people who have learned to deceive themselves come with a myriads of unhealthy traits. This fake sense of superiority’s first victim is the willingness to try out new things. Kids don’t care what they look like, how rich or poor they are, how tall they are, the color of their skin - and they know how to participate even when they are sure to fail. That’s how all of us took our first steps! We failed again and again (with a lot of people watching!) We are talking about people who don’t try new things because they might fail. They would demean, insult and try self-deception to get out of knowing about something new because that’s easier than facing failure.There’s a thing about science - it doesn’t care about our societal status! Science can tell even the most influential person that they are wrong. The people we are talking about then, do not have a scientific method. They might be scientists, scholars, doctors and engineers but, they are scared of science! These are people who are most gullible when it comes to “ancient wisdom”. These are people who would tell you that “science does not have all the answers” to justify a scientifically incorrect view that they hold close to heart. Since these are people who are all about authority, they find it difficult to defy authority. Deliver an authoritative judgement about an issue and they would take it to their graves. These are personality worshipers, they follow ideologies over methods. For them science comes in 2 flavors - “my science” and “their science”. One is wrong and the other is right. These are people who have a “right way to drink alcohol”, “authentic recipes”, “correct grammar”, “the best workout”, “traditional is better” approach to life!Another classic identification is the victim game. Such people find victims for their wits, sarcasm, wisdom and knowledge (Think about it! Victim of knowledge!). They thrive in groups that they can control and they always have a victim who is miserable. When the tables turn, things become ugly! The are always on the lookout for issues with others around them and they try their best to expose them. While they try their best to hide their own insecurities, they use all their social intellect to identify others’ insecurities and use them against their victims. They are usually very good at the insecurities game because they swim in it more often than others. A good way to know this is to compare their behavior in a group versus when they are alone with you (alone is generally a lot nicer and very likeable).Such people often have very magnetic personalities. Abusive relationships have this character as well. It often becomes impossible to leave the tormentor because they are so good to you at times! So good that you love them! When these people are not around, we terribly miss them. Remember, they are very good at reading insecurities!These people are easy to spot online as well - #onlyWayToLive #beLikeMe #alwaysTheBest and sometimes, #worstPlaceOnEarth #cantHearThisCrappyMusic #whyAreAllPeopleSoStupid (notice the “all or nothing” feeling there? You should read more about it!)Well, that said, what’s the solution? Should there be a large scale LSD-in-water-supply project to repair the world? I can offer my insights about my own battle with insecurities, anxiety and depression. The solution depends on which side of the facade you are (I’ve been on both and its not fun at all!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with when you are a victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victim cheat code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware of yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for signs like limited social interaction, limited participation in social activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the scientific method religiously (see, what I did there :D )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t take yourself too seriously (check out Dudeism!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you feel things are going out of hand, avoid or confront the people in your life who you think might need help in dealing with their insecurities and anxiety (let experts handle it though).A good question to ask is - “Can I be completely honest around this person?” If the answer is “No”, there’s a problem that needs to be addressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are a lot more complicated when the facade has caged you inside a growing mass of insecurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beat your insecurities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest! Avoid even white lies (no they are not required to live in the world!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sincere in your judgement of yourself. Be open about failure, about being wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn that competition inward. Compete with your own self and start by attempting to fail without feeling miserable about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about mental health with your friends and family. Depression and anxiety affects us all on some level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting yourself in others’ shoes is a great technique to still “get things done” while being nice to others. Try it as often as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about your insecurities (even the most private ones!) Talking about things engages your prefrontal cortex (the region of your brain that makes you human) and eases the fears and anxiety that your amygdala (the reptilian brain) is constructing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to be more mindful. Meditation is great (try to learn it the right way and avoid mixing it with religion/spirituality - see the next point)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to be more flexible and open to new ideas and changes in life. “Ancient wisdom” belongs in the ancient times.&lt;/li&gt;

Let’s jump right in:Time your shower. Also, limit the time you take to decide what to wear for the day. On an average, people might spend between 30 minutes to 1 hour on this daily activity. Reduce it to under 10 minutes.Time saved: 15 Minutes!Replace music with earplugs. We listen to music, while working, to drown out the noise. This might not seem like a distraction since we are so used to it, but in the end you’ll end up taking more time to do every task. Buy some good quality earplugs and create a 25/5 minutes rule - work with earplugs for 25 minutes, then take a music and water break for 5 minutes (also, walk around to get those steps!). You will find your productivity increase (you’ll enjoy music better too!) Calibrate your time saved but, my experience is that your productivity would go up by at least 20% -&gt; for an 8-10 hour work day, you should be able to save about 2 hours!Time saved: 2 hours!Eat with a (very) small set of people. Eating time is meant for eating. Eating alone can be difficult for a few people but, ensure that you avoid big groups while going for lunch/dinner. Bigger groups at the lunch table result in less time spent on eating and more spent on banter. This is REALLY BAD for your health as well! When we chit-chat while eating, we are more likely to over/under eat and in general, not enjoy our food a lot.If a discussion is happening over lunch, ensure that the discussion starts and ends before everyone begins to eat (remember to not start the discussion before the order is placed!). If you eat 3 meals a day, you can save an average of 15 minutes per meal.Time saved: 45 minutes!Shut-down at least an hour before your sleep time. This might sound counter-intuitive but, we waste a lot of time sleeping because we don’t have regular sleeping times. When you shut-down an hour before sleeping and engage in things like meditation or take a cold shower and prepare for bed, you can easily reduce the twisting-turning time that spills over to the low productivity levels early in the morning. This alone can add several minutes (even hours!) to your day so I won’t count this in.Time saved: A LOT!Have distraction-free family time. We do the things we do for our loved ones! Quality family time is not just about the time spent together. If we are not really with them, when we are together, we would be forced to sit through a crappy movie, forced to respond to WhatsApp texts while we are at work and forced to do several other things that never actually feel like we’ve spent time together at all. A good, engaging discussion after finishing dinner is far better than time spent together watching NEWS! Do this and you’d see not just having more time on your hands but a much deeper connect with people you love! I won’t time this one either because family deserves all the time after all!Remember, no phones, no TV, no work calls, no other distractions when you are with other people - they deserve your time!Time saved: A LOT!Switch off the Television; throw it out of your house. After Vietnam’s disasters, one general of the US army commented - “We should’ve just given them free Television sets!” If there’s one mode of misery that connects all of humanity today, it is the tele! Television doesn’t just make you dumb every minute you spend time on it, it actually sets you up for all sorts of nasty social disasters as well. Let things of importance come to you! A neurotic tweet by a deranged person is not worth your time! A prime-time discussion about that tweet might sound like “intellectual orgasm” but, it is absolute garbage! Switch off the TV and you easily save several hours a day!Time saved: 1 hour (or 5 if you like to keep yourself really “informed”)!There you go! These are not difficult things to do and they certainly don’t turn you into a robot! If anything, these would improve the quality of your personal and social life!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hacking My Biology]]></title><description><![CDATA[I tried simple changes to my life to live a fuller, more meaningful life.]]></description><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/hacking-my-biology</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/hacking-my-biology</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 20:37:54 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Have you heard about bio-hacking? Depending on who you heard it from (and how much they love their alcohol), you might think that it is a story leaping out of a Black Mirror episode or that it is the best thing to ever come to your life/lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get done with the commonly perceived ideas first. The essentials of bio-hacking include things that you can do - invasive/non-invasive/supplements/drugs/lifestyle changes  - to make everlasting improvements to how you feel everyday (both mind and body). You would hear about Nootropics like Modafinil, MDMA, etc. You would also hear about crazy lasers looking into your scalp, funny looking eye-wear, thermal jackets that let you adjust the temperature of your body from an app so you can sleep better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, to be honest, those are the holy grail of bio-hacking. If you can pop 200mg of Modafinil everyday without it affecting your health (kidney, liver, etc.), you can get a lot more done in a regular day than most people around you. But, to get to those super-human mental abilities, you need to make some dramatic changes to your lifestyle so that your body is in a supreme state of health to be able to support a brain that’s working more efficiently than ever before! Implants, neural-link, and every crazy thing comes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think of bio-hacking as a mechanism to optimise every aspect of my life. Every part of my body needs to be working at an optimal level. Let me break it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to convince you how important a good sleep is. But, let me use this topic to introduce compound interest to you. Just like the money on CI in a bank, every night of disturbed sleep feeds into a continuous cycle of doom! Each night you don’t sleep well, you add poison to your body. This CI principle applies to every aspect of bio-hacking. Every good thing you do to your mind/body adds up, every bad thing adds up as well! Here’s my strategy for sleep which is really something your grandmother would agree with - sleep for at least 8 hours a day, sleep everyday at the same time, don’t sleep on a full stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the simple part. Now, let’s add an OCD type finesse to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wear blue-light blocking glasses (blue light reduces the production of melatonin in your body which is how your circadian rhythm regulates sleeping and waking hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I take ice-cold water showers just before sleeping if I’m finding it difficult to stop my mind from racing around - your body temperature needs to be lowered to prepare you for sleep, you can induce it artificially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t eat anything after 19:00 hours. That gives me enough time to enter a ketosis state right when I go to bed - the brain needs the best quality nutrition during sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also use ear-plugs several minutes before I hit the bed. I sleep wearing them (you’ll get used to it in 2-3 days!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stop indulging in my phone/laptop at least a few hours before I sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least an hour before I sleep, I switch off even the minutest of LEDs (that uber-cool sleep light of your MacBook that resembles your breathing rhythm could wake you up in the middle of the night without you knowing that you woke up!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use an app, SleepCycle, that monitors my sleep. (It also measures my resting heart rate every morning!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t drink coffee after 13:00. With my high metabolism, that’s the best I can do. Anything later than that would affect my sleep!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several bio-hackers take sleep inducing melatonin sprays, etc. to get a good night’s sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another obvious topic but, when you add the bio-hacking optimisation zeal to it, it turns into a very powerful tool. Things you eat power your brain’s health. Eat healthy! But, with so many different cultures promoting their own “healthy diet”, it is difficult to zero in on just one. To be honest, that’s not true! We know what’s healthy and what’s not. Our body knows as well. If you feel bloated after a meal, you’ve either eaten too much or something that you should not have! I combine a (mostly) Keto diet with Intermittent Fasting (IF). Here are the things that I’ve been doing for several months/years. But, now I do them with zero cheat days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I fast. A lot. There are days when I eat just a single meal. There have been weeks in the past when I relied only on water! It started off as a personal challenge to gain control over my mind - “A person who can fast, think and meditate can do anything in life.” - Herman Hesse in Siddhartha (slightly modified to make it inclusive.) Here’s the great thing about IF, if you want to lose weight, you don’t need to eat something special, you just need to stop eating! Start small, there are several great resources to equip yourself with the knowledge you need to start IF so that you understand what’s happening to your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t consume processed sugar in any form! I’ve conditioned my brain in such a way now, that I feel disgusted when I see a piece of rich cake!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t eat right before you hit the bed - that’s the worst thing that you can do to your sleep! (This was mentioned in the sleep section as well. That’s not mindless repetition, it’s part of a theme that I’ll spell out for you towards the end! Hang on!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat natural. I get my proteins from animal sources (mostly) but, I cook a ton a vegetables at home. It is healthy to cook your own meal - therapeutic and you know what’s going into your body!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I eat very limited amounts of processed food. A hearty burger with a thin slice of bread after 20 hours of fasting is my “cheat day”!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I follow a 8/16 fasting regimen - eat for 8 hours, fast for 16! Out of those 16, I sleep 8 so, it’s not as difficult as it sounds. People do a “Warrior’s regimen” as well - 4/20. See what works best for you. The Intermittent Fasting is possibly the hardest to start with for most people. I say this because I’ve been trying to promote IF for the past several years when I discovered the joys of fasting and I don’t know anyone that I was able to convince yet! That said, if you plan well, it is very easy to do. Always remember, less than 10,000 years ago, we did not have farming, we went for hunting and at times returned with no food for the family!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about poison entering your body! There’s nothing worse than alcohol and tobacco for you! I mean, yes, you’ll die faster if you gulped down some mercury but, seriously, we should all question our governments about the legality of these things! Alcohol - in any amount - kills! All those “health wine” “studies” are total crap. Alcohol is very bad for you, even in limited amounts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for tobacco. Tobacco is a toxin that the tobe-plant produces to protect itself from predators. It is supposed to be lethal for anyone with muscles and a relatively smaller body-mass! If we consumed it in large quantities, proportional to our body mass, we would die just like that poor caterpillar that attacks the plant. Nicotine does help you to relax your mind but, the net loss is just too big! When you smoke (anything!), you inhale some extremely poisonous gases, tar and a host of terrible things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t have a drop of alcohol anymore!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hang out with people who are cool with that. Most reasonable, adults are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t smoke! (The pollution in Bangalore is enough worry for me already - please suggest a good pollution mask?) When I go out with friends who smoke, I insist on sitting in the non-smoking area or somewhere well ventilated. Sometimes I get lucky!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a theme here already? These are not things we didn’t know about. All regular stuff, done with a brutal honesty to yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the exercise that works best for you! Although, any exercise is potentially good, pumping iron alone would not give you a supreme health! It might give your body a super-human strength but, your mind and other important organs might suffer if you are not careful. I would recommend that you mix days of heavy and light workout. Here’s what I do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoga and Pilates everyday - I start my day with these and do them several times a day since it does not need a special arrangement or a lot of time (or a shower afterwards!). Just stretch when you like you’ve been sitting for too long! My FitBit helps to remind me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve been trying to work on my hand-stand for the past year (I started because I saw some gorgeous pictures of my ex-boyfriend doing hand-stands in Borneo Island :P ). I’ve made considerable progress after I started Pilates for strength!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I try to run every evening (having a friend to nudge you works really well here!). I do some 10-15 minutes of slow pace running followed by a very intense sprint to death. I’ve been able to bring my resting hearth rate to around 60 after I started preparing my hearth for some serious pumping action - the SMART Goal is to bring it between 55-60!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutal Honesty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one’s the most important thing in my opinion! Be brutally honest about yourself. Lying takes a lot of energy! Your brain has to work extra hard on things that are mostly not even important. In my experience, people lie because they want to create deception (an innately human quality) to their advantage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While honesty would not help you to win over the liars, a brutal honesty would be impossible to defeat! Try it out for yourself. Not having to lie in any situation requires practice but, once you start doing it, there’s no turning back and things become easy!Here are a few things people often lie about which I avoid at any cost:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sexual experiences, sexuality, sexual expressions. It happens to be a very important aspect of being human (more to follow in the next section). There’s no need to lie about sex, (almost) everyone does it! Duh!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple things like - “How do I look?” - Don’t lie there, people will stop trusting you soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lying to escape authority - I think authority needs to be called out. I am as equal as anyone else on this planet, I don’t need your authority. I tell people when they are being authoritative. Some of them get pissed, some understand and I get improved versions of these individuals to hang out with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex is important for a healthy adult. Human beings (just like other animals) start engaging in sexual experiences right after/during puberty. It is an activity that gives extreme pleasure which is (as of now, things, hopefully, would change soon) not possible by any other means. If you’ve tried having dopamine, serotonin explosions in your head by other means, you would know what I mean. Things are not so simple with sex. Somehow, it is not just about the chemicals (although you can enhance the experience exponentially if your brain gets artificial supplies of these chems!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all its advantages, sex can be pretty harmful. Too less or too much of it can make you go insane! This is an area of your life that you need to optimise as best as possible because we have so less control over it. Here are some things that might help, although these things are ultra-personalised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find steady sex partners who are comfortable with you. Saves a lot of Tinder time if you have a list of numbers on your phone already! I know who to call when!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human beings are serial monogamists. Follow that pattern and you’ll not have love-sex crisis in your life ever!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I have sex with a stranger/non-lover, I try to have a role-play scenario in my head. I pretend that we are lovers. Works wonders for me. I have a very vivid imagination :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it safe! There are ways in which you can include safe sex in your sexual fantasy and make the safer versions work out better than the others!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t watch porn. Even if it works for you, it would cripple your imagination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t worry too much about “love”. Yes, it’s better when done with love but, finding love, retaining it, keeping it healthy - all these are very harsh trade-offs. Keeping things simple has worked out much better for me in the last couple of years!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make breakfast/lunch/tea for your hook-ups. Both of you would feel great when doing it the next time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are other things that can be done to enhance your sexual experience but, I won’t go into that due to legal reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing you should do after reading this terribly long (but, hopefully useful) post, it should be to take time out to meditate everyday! If you ace this one thing, you can do several others with very less effort! There are several ways to reach that “flow” state. I started my journey a few years ago using some random focusing techniques. Then moved to the S N Goenka’s meditation method. I would highly recommend that! There are some neat meditation techs that the Neurosciences department of Stanford often talks about. Check them out as well. Essentially, having a control over your “reptilian brain” should become your life’s purpose! Conquer that and you have everything else within your reach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I meditate several times a day when I think my mind is going astray.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation just before bed/in-bed is pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve used the iOS App “Headspace” at times for some guided meditation. The narrator’s voice is seductive :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve been able to direct my brain to reach orgasmic levels of detachment (le petite mort!) lately! (The first time that happened was when I was camping next to the Parvaty river in Kasol, Himachal Pradesh!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drink up water! Several times a day! Water is a good source of Lithium as well, which is responsible for an optimal brain performance! Some important things to keep in mind about hydration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You body loses water with every breath. That means, your body would require hydration before you feel uncomfortable or dehydrated. Keep a water bottle next to you. Or set a timer!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I drink hot water when I wake up, or before a shower, to heat my body from within. Cold water does the opposite so, I don’t drink any hot fluids before hitting the bed. Remember: Cold body =&gt; Prepare to sleep. Hot body =&gt; Get ready to work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t substitute water with carbonated drinks, caffeinated drinks, artificially sweetened fluids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several great hydration strategies that I’m exploring myself. More on that soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Interactions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limit your regular social interactions to a small subset of meaningful ones! Very cautiously (and quite ruthlessly at times) remove all negative people from your life. There would be a few that you can’t do much about, try to change them or limit that interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are nasty because they need help! If you are not in a position to provide that help, stay away! Don’t jump into a well of negative thoughts because of these people who are doomed!
Social media is the worst thing to have happened to us! It has become that necessary demon that one cannot stay too far away from. Use very good judgement on every minute you spend on social media (as with people having a negative impact on your life!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t have Facebook on my phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My activity in most social media is on need based - I post but, don’t consume too much. I don’t have notifications turned on for most apps on my phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m brutally honest with people around me. If they don’t like honestly, they distance themselves from me - saves me the effort to come up with a confrontational encounter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of which, I confront people in my lives. A lesson an old friend taught me. Sometime, you just have to tell people what you feel for them to understand you better. Don’t work on assumptions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify people who are beyond repair (that can be carried out by you!). Leave them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to improve your Social Intelligence every day. I try to have conversations with strangers I meet on the streets, in the bus, when I go shopping, etc. Smile at people you don’t know! Anxiety needs work, it won’t go away auto-magically!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use Apps like WoeBot (developed by Professor Andrew Ng’s team) that help me interact with the world outside in a much better way by teaching me terminology to talk about my own behaviour and mood!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with people you meet. Don’t just meet them. (You would be forced to do this if you meet them with no alcohol on the table or cigarette in your hands! Work at it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have spent several weeks learning about human behaviour from one of the finest people alive - Dr. Robert Sapolsky! His video lecture series (Stanford) is available online - It would change your life!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also, try to understand what the other person is going through so that my words/actions have the effect I want them to have on my interactions with them. It needs practice, I’m practicing! Brutal honesty can help here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditions vs Scientific Method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last topic but, I think it is the most important! There is real wealth in traditional techniques like Fasting, Meditation, etc. But, that’s where you should stop. Adopting a scientific method to evaluate all aspects of your life would help you make rational choices in life. If you prefer to go by what your “gut says”, do that by all means but, also try to understand what gives rise to that gut feeling. There are very valid scientific approaches to living that are being investigated everyday. New evidences are coming to light each hour. Some of it is hopefully going to align with your belief system but, most of it would not! You need to be prepared to let the cognitive dissonances in your life dissolve without much resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a person coming from a religious family, making peace with my atheistic belief system was the hardest part - luckily, I did that when my Prefrontal Cortex was still under development. For a lot of us beyond 25 years of age, fighting these religious ideas, traditions, dogmas would be a great challenge. A good way to start would be to understand the origins of religion and religiosity. Dr. Sapolsky can come to the rescue here as well. With that in mind, let’s talk about the final topic and probably the most important!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress - One Ring to Rule Them All&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do everything right, follow things to the last detail, be brutally honest about your lifestyle, you could still see yourself going down a spiral of death if you don’t manage stress in your life! Those Glucocordicoids are a friend but, only in limited and well controlled quantities!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my previous managers had the belief that “people work better under fear”. Although it sounds stupid, a lot of people work like that. So much so that, we often prefer leaders who treat us like shit! There’s a good read on Creativity and stress by the Harvard Business Review that you might want to check out as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a remarkable lecture on stress and depression: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfcIf&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfcIf&lt;/a&gt; you watch one thing today, watch this! Do this stress business right and everything will fall in place, get this part wrong and everything spirals back into disaster!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you know why carefully eliminating stressful people in your life is so important! It’s the people around us that give us stress. If your code does not compile, the machine is not going to complain, your boss would!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the bio-hacks I talked about work only if done together. You neglect one and everything else will crumble down. Have a great diet, exercise routine, healthy interactions and drink a glass of wine and, you’ve ruined everything! You might not see the changes because they are very subtle - but hey, we’ve all had that morning after that binge drinking, when we woke up with a swollen face and a demolished spirit! Don’t do that to yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the term “bio-hacking” seems a lot less of a “hack” to you now. There are absolutely no downsides, only massive gains that work like compound interest and make each day better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there is one downside, I guess. You’ll have so much energy and focus throughout the day that you’ll spend like, 2 hours writing about it in your blog just because a friend asked you for “a link that would tell me more, most of the things I’m reading online are freaking me out!” So yeah, have fun hacking your biology! Like always, please reach out with comments and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SBT - Scala’s ((mistaken as) NOT SO) Simple Build Tool]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/sbt-basic-introduction</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/sbt-basic-introduction</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 23:03:08 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first thing that one notices when jumping into Scala development is its utterly complicated build tool. Complications arise due to several reasons (and reasons different for different people, I’m sure) but, a consistent gripe that people seems to have is the syntax used in the build definition file (typically build.sbt although, any *.sbt would work at the root of the project) for people not very familiar with some operators/constructors that the Scala community heavily relies on and, the monstrous amount of time it takes to get the first build started. The syntax seems strange at times even for Scala developers not familiar with sbt, that is because sbt is a DSL (Domain Specific Language). Let’s dive in to understand the essential basics![When I first ran “sbt run”, I wasn’t sure if things were even working at all, stared into the terminal for few 10s of minutes for several hours and nothing showed up. Google searches showed that it was a common problem! Although, in my case it was a conflict between the versions of Scala and sbt that were individually installed on my machine!]With that welcoming note, let’s dive into the sbt world - it is bound to make your life easier if you know what you are doing. And it is an extremely powerful build tool.I highly recommend that you read the sbt getting started guide completely before starting your project (this post is not a replacement as there are several details that are important and won’t be discussed here). I’m assuming that you’ve installed a recent version of sbt already. I’m writing this to provide a quick start (which might be a lot quicker than the “Quick Start Guide” that sbt documentation provides.)Getting Started With “sbt new”The recent versions of sbt (later than 0.13) provide a quick way to kick start your Scala projects  -$ sbt new sbt/scala-seed.g8sbt uses g8 templates to create the basic structure of your project. There are tons of useful ones available and you can create your own as well. If you come from the Java world, think of these as Maven archetypes of sorts. The command above would ask you for some project details like the project name, my project’s name is: Whipp. (For reasons unknown to humanity!)The previous command should set up a simple Scala project for you with a directory structure that resembles that used by Maven: src/[main, test]/[scala, java, resources] $ tree -L 2.├── build.sbt├── project│   ├── Dependencies.scala│   ├── build.properties│   ├── plugins.sbt│   ├── project│   └── target├── src│   ├── main│   └── test└── target    ├── scala-2.12    └── streams9 directories, 4 filesThe file that would the focus of our discussion in this post is the build.sbt file - the build definition.(Don’t forget to add target/ to your .gitignore before you make your initial commit.)Running the project:Building and running the project is simple:$ sbt #takes you to the sbt shell from where you can issue commands like run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[info] sbt server started at 127.0.0.1:5522&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sbt:Whipp&gt; run #The task we wish to execute. This would compile the project files and start the project. This could take a while if you are running your first project. Patience trumps hate!Some cool things about the sbt shell are its tab-completion feature and history. It essentially behaves like your terminal’s shell. Pretty cool huh?You could also provide tasks in a “batch mode” like this:#takes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sbt:Whipp&gt; clean compile runsbt provides a continuous build option. Append a task with ~ and sbt would watch for changes in your files, auto compile them and, execute the task - for instance, ~run would add efficiency to your development setup!Here’s a list of all the commands available for you to use: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Command-Line-Reference.htmlThe&quot;&gt;https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Command-Line-Reference.htmlThe&lt;/a&gt; build definition - build.sbtThis is the most important and interesting section of this post so grab your coffee and read on! The key element in understanding the build.sbt file is that it is not just a properties file but, valid Scala code (well, valid sbt DSL code to be precise but, you get the drift!) Read the generated *.sbt file with that perspective first and see what you can gather from it:import Dependencies._lazy val root = (project in file(”.”)).  settings(    inThisBuild(List(      organization := “com.snortingcode”,      scalaVersion := “2.12.3”,      version      := “0.1.0-SNAPSHOT”    )),    name := “Whipp”,    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(      scalaTest % Test)  )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Depending on which seed project you start with, this might look a little different. Hold on for a while and it would make a lot of sense to you!)Let’s first look at what the below line is all about:“lazy val root = (project in file(“.”))”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are declaring a lazy value ‘root’ which happens to be everything followed by “lazy val root” in this case. Your build file is composed of several “val” and/or “lazy val”, these would typically fall under these 3 categories:SettingKey[T]TaskKey[T]InputKey[T]In fact, if you take a look at the config-classes under the target/ directory, you would find a cache file that has all the lazy val and val that you defined in your build.sbt file. You can also use the sbt shell to see what these keys are.With that in mind, if you look at the build.sbt again, you’d see that we have a lazy val called root that contains the settings for each “project” in the current directory [project in file(“.”)]Some of these are generic properties like the name of the project, organisation, etc. These are unlikely to change (it is a common practice to extract them out to a val and add it to the project.settings.)In that sense, most of the build definition is just a bunch of key-value pairs =&gt; some help define things, some do interesting stuff. The value “name” is an example of a key that defines something. A quick digression: If you try to assign a non-String value to “name”, you would get a typeMismatch error. The key “name” (which we did not define ourselves) comes along with the implied imports =&gt; sbt.&lt;em&gt;, Keys.&lt;/em&gt;Let’s try to add some interesting key that does something. Naturally, we would turn to a TaskKey[T]. Add these lines to your build definition:lazy val doSomething = taskKey&lt;a href=&quot;%E2%80%9CI%20do%20something%20cool!%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;Unit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, add this key to your settings. The updated build.sbt might look something like this:import Dependencies._lazy val root = (project in file(”.”)).  settings(    inThisBuild(List(      organization := “com.snortingcode”,      scalaVersion := “2.12.3”,      version      := “0.1.0-SNAPSHOT”    )),    name := “Whipp”,    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(      scalaTest % Test),    doSomething := {println(“Look what I did!”)}  )lazy val doSomething = taskKey&lt;a href=&quot;%E2%80%9CI%20do%20something%20cool!%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;Unit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We defined a TaskKey[Unit] named doSomething using the method in the sbt DSL - taskKey[T]. Once you enter the sbt console (by restarting the sbt shell), you would notice that you can call this new task from the shell, simply by typing the task’s name - doSomething.sbt:Whipp&gt; doSomethingLook what I did![success] Total time: 1 s, completed 8 Feb, 2018 1:59:01 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can thus, create a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) using these tasks and create a workflow for your project! Sweet!A neat way to see what a task is doing is to “inspect” it:sbt:Whipp&gt;inspect compile[info] Task: xsbti.compile.CompileAnalysis[info] Description:[info] 	Compiles sources.[info] Provided by:[info] 	{file:/Users/prasoonjoshi/code/whipp/whipp/}root/compile:compile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The actual output is rather long, so I’ve truncated it. Each [info] tells you important information about that task. (Try this out with the doSomething task you created just now and see if everything makes sense!)We talked about the SettingKey[T] and TaskKey[T] a little bit, what is this InputKey[T] all about? Well, for now, you can just think of the InputKey as a method to take input from the user to create tasks on the fly (simple and powerful - we’ll talk about this in a future post soon!)Let’s jump to the libraryDependencies Yes, you know what they are! The essential information about this section of your build definition’s settings are: += is a method to append the provided dependency to the old libraryDependencies and return the new one!libraryDependencies ++= Seq[&lt;your list of dependencies&gt;] is another way you’ll see the dependencies often defined in the build definition. (This is what our example build definition has.)sbt uses Ivy for dependency resolution. The % that you see in the syntax below are sbt DSL’s methods that construct the Ivy module Id.To define a new libraryDependency, you need to define the dependency first, then add it to the list of dependencies.Here’s an example that adds mongo awesomeness to your project:val mongo = “org.reactivemongo” %% “reactivemongo” % “0.12.6”libraryDependencies += mongo#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This line is part of my plugins.sbt file under the project directory. addSbtPlugin(“com.typesafe.play” % “sbt-plugin” % “2.6.7”)libraryDependencies += ws&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can add the val directly to the settings without declaring it first. See what works best for you!I promised earlier that everything in your build definition is just a key (SettingKey, TaskKey, InputKey). See what the libraryDependencies key shows you on the sbt shell and see if that makes sense :)A final note on the evaluation order in your build definition file: Since the build definition is just a DAG which is interspersed with “lazy val”, you should expect a sequential processing, with lazy val(s) evaluated only when they are required.A point to keep in mind is that the SettingKeys are evaluated once, TaskKeys are evaluated each time the task is executed (these would usually have side-effects as you can see).There are several beautiful aspects of sbt that we can’t explore here in this quick guide. I would encourage you to check out the documentation and Josh Suereth’s great talk on YouTube.[Please do reach out to suggest improvements or corrections to this post :) ]&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Higher Order Functions]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/higher-order-functiona</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/higher-order-functiona</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2018 02:29:12 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;[This is part of a series of posts on Scala and Functional Programming:
Part 1: Scala Tricks - tupled/untupled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Higher Order Functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 3: Cooking yummy Functional code - (partial, curry, compose)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a basic introduction to Scala, syntax, etc. you can check out Scala Fast Lane
]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve heard about Higher Order Functions already. You might have even used them in your favorite programming languages. Hopefully, I’ll give some insights here that would cement your understanding of HOFs and motivate you to try a Functional Programming language that does a lot more with HOFs than your favorite programming language can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, a Higher Order Function is one that takes another function as a parameter or returns another function as a result. But, let’s take a couple of steps back and look at what we mean by a “function”. The best way to understand this is to forget all you know about functions from a programming perspective and think of that old friend, Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in mathematics, functions define a mapping between a domain and a co-domain. For instance, let’s consider a function that takes two number and returns the product of the two numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scala&gt; def mult(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x * y&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mult: (x: Int, y: Int)Int&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be fairly simple to understand but, let me add a quick explanation just to add rigor to the post: the function “mult” takes 2 Integer arguments in a single argument list (yes, we can have multiple argument lists to a function which, as it turns out, is very useful and we’ll explore it in a future post) - x and y, and returns another Integer that is the product of the two - x*y. (Yes, the return type should not be Int but, we’ll use this ‘problem’ to illustrate an important point in a future post - Scala types and pattern matching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this stuff is easy. Running this code in a scala Repl would give you a function object that has a type: (Int, Int) =&gt; Int
Meaning, it takes two Integers and returns another Integer. Simple stuff so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions are just that, a relationship that converts one type to another using some defined transformations. Since, these functions are only defining the relationships that exists between two different ‘types’, we have a sense of “purity” when we talk about such functions - they don’t change over time and/or with parameters passed to them. The pure functions are like a Knight with a clear conscience - they always produce the same result for the same set of parameters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 intuitions that might help in understanding “Pure Functions”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions are relationships (also called “Morphisms” or simply “arrows” in Category Theory) between two types.
Functions try to define “what things are” not “how to perform a task”.
With that, let’s talk about functions in an imperative language like Java. In a language like Java/Python, etc. the programmer needs to define what to do with each parameter and how to produce the result. Functional Programming takes a different (better!) approach, it defines what things are and how to “make one given the other” and how to compose bigger ideas from smaller ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a function, thus defined, is just an abstraction over a Type, we can tinker with it the way we like without disturbing its identity, by composing/decomposing functions together that don’t violate the restrictions that the Types impose on them (It is these restrictions that the functions must honor that give the teeth to these types!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a good way to look at functions is by visualizing the whole code-base as a network where, contrary to a similar analogy in other languages, the functions are the edges of the graph and, the data (Types) flow via these edges from one Type to the other (or same like in our example above) bringing about the necessary transformations. This analogy, I think, is a great way to look at functional code and helps to design bigger, complicated systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at how a higher order function would fit into this understanding. We know that functions can exist on their own (functions are first-class citizens in a functional programming language) or be part of an Object, in which case they are called methods (There’s a neat trick that converts a method to a function that we’ll talk about in a bit - lifting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compose-ability of pure functions (and the way they preserve the type system by definition) is what gives rise to the need (and use) of HOFs. Let’s expand on our tiny example a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that the function mult (Int, Int) =&gt; Int is not just multiplying 2 Integers, but these Integers mean something. Let’s just say that this function mult defines the relationship between variables of a term in a linear equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;def hypothesis(A, X) = ∑ (a*x) , for a in A and x in X&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, A is a Vector of coefficients and X is a Vector representing some variables. More precisely, let’s define a few Types here to help the intuition we are trying to build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scala&gt; type A = Int
defined type alias A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scala&gt; type B = Int
defined type alias B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scala&gt; def hypothesis(a: Seq[A], x: Seq[X]) = ???
hypothesis: (a: A, b: B)Int&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve just defined some type alias. We can now use A, B for Int. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hypothesis(Seq[A], Seq[X]) is now a valid Scala function. We’ve not defined the implementation of this function yet, but, this is valid since function definitions are evaluated when they are called (every time they are called!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try to implement this function and see how things go. We’ll start in a (mostly) imperative way and try to improve as we go along:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scala&amp;gt; def hypothesis(a: Seq[A], x: Seq[X]): Int =&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might look a bit disturbing if you come from an imperative world (which you most likely do) but, try spending a few minutes reading the code and see if it makes any sense to you before reading further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function hypothesis takes two Sequences as parameters (Think of Seq for now as a collection with an Iterator and Order between elements), zips them together forming a collection that has pairs (tuples), each of which has the first element from ‘a’ and the second element from ‘b’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scala&gt; val a = Seq(1, 2, 3, 4)
a: Seq[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scala&gt; val x = Seq(1, 2, 3, 4)
x: Seq[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scala&gt; a zip x
res12: Seq[(Int, Int)] = List((1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for (e &amp;#x3C;- elems) yield (doSomething(e))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;takes elements from ‘elems’ one at a time as ‘e’ and do something with that (any functional transformation, etc.) This would work well and is fairly easy to read and expressive enough to be understood in a shared code-base. The function ‘sum’ chained at the end would give us the summation that we required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the relationship between A and X changes and is not defined by a simple product but, some other function complexProd. This change would require us to re-write the definition of the hypothesis function and would lead to code duplication and in general would be a nasty thing to do! This is where HOFs would come to our rescue. Let’s see how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scala&gt; def betterHypo(a: Seq[A], x: Seq[X], f(a: A, x: X): Int): Int =
    | (for ((a, x) &amp;#x3C;- (a zip x)) yield f(a, x)).sum
betterHypo: (a: Seq[A], b: Seq[B], f: (Int, Int) =&gt; Int)Int&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve passed a function, ‘f(a: A, x: X): Int’ to this betterHypo function so that the way we define the relationship between A and X is abstracted out of the function. We can stretch this idea and think of functions that return functions that can later be applied to some parameters in another higher order function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think of functions as an immutable system of arrows from one Type to the other which doesn’t care to say much about the individual elements of the Types alone but, about the Type itself. This is a good intuition to build and a nice parallel emerging from Category Theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next installment of these set of posts on Scala/FP, I would talk more about Partial Functions, partial application of functions and Currying. Go functional :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scala Tricks - tupled/untupled]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/scala-tricks-tupled-untupled</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/scala-tricks-tupled-untupled</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 22:12:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;[This is part of a series of posts on Scala and Functional Programming:Part 1: Scala Tricks - tupled/untupledPart 2: Higher Order Functions]I started learning functional programming a couple of years ago. Started with this brilliant book called “Learn you a Haskell for Great Good”. I don’t think I can recommend a beginner book on a complex topic like FP more than this beauty. It doesn’t claim to make you an expert in FP or explain the underlying Category Theory as such but it does attempt to make the subject less scary and adds a lot of fun during your initial exploration.The best part about this book, I mentioned, is that it doesn’t try to teach an OOP person how to transition to FP. Instead, it talks about FP in its own right most of the times and it is able to do it because, well, the book is supposed to be fun and possibly not a comprehensive guide to FP (another fun book that changed the way I looked at Python was Why’s “The Poignant Guide to Ruby” - do check it out!)That said, when you start getting into FP with an intention to have it pay your bills eventually, you might have to switch to languages like Scala. The reason that makes Scala a rational choice to start with FP is the same that makes it a bit silly to programmers new to FP - it let’s you do things the OO way as well.With that background, let’s look at a particular trick in Scala and explore some aspects of FP along the way:Functional Programming is all about programming with functions (Duh!) Every other selling point of FP that you hear about is a direct implication of this fact - immutability, code reuse, concise representation of complicated ideas making modeling of the physical world a lot easier. If you keep this as a central idea when you think about a problem, it would help you to write code that works and is efficient. Let’s consider a function that takes 3 arguments from a Tuple (which is an immutable collection of ‘objects’ with equality of two tuples dependent, not just on the contents of the collection but, also on the relative position of each object in the collection) and adds them together to produce a result:def addElements(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int): Int = { … }
Let’s quickly walk through the syntax here:‘def’ defines a function, the function addElements takes a single list of 3 parameters a, b and c and produces a result. The type of the parameters and the result is given after a “:” following the thing you are providing the types for. (The type system of any FP is very interesting, I’ll write a detailed post on that soon!)Now, a way to call this method would be to take the Tuple apart and pass each of its 3 elements as 3 separate arguments to this function:val tup = (100, 200, 300) //’val’ defines an immutable value, a tuple in this case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;addElements(tup._1, tup._2, tup._3)This approach certainly works but, looks like a stinking garbage dump to a Functional programmer. Let’s fix it:val betterAddElements = Function.tupled(addElements _)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;betterAddElements(tup)We used the function “tupled” to convert the addElements function to a function that takes the tuple itself and knows exactly how to extract each element of the tuple and produce the same result that we expect from addElements. (The untupled method does the inverse - given a function that takes a tuple, it converts the function to one that takes individual parameters.) You can think of some sort of a magic wrapper around your method that lets you do this but, this magic wrapper is a direct result of any functional programming language design.There’s a lot of FP magic happening here that I can’t cover in this post because it would make it too long and may confuse the programmer new to FP. The magic can be summed up in a few keywords - higher order functions, partial application, pattern matching (and that curious ‘_’ passed as an argument to Function.tupled)I’ll write a post about each of them because they require a separate treatment. Stay tuned :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting the data-types right or terribly wrong]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/getting-data-types-right-or-terribly-wrong</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/getting-data-types-right-or-terribly-wrong</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2017 18:39:10 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I explore the world of Functional Programming more, I can see myself getting obsessed with getting the Type system right for any app that I’m working on. While it is more natural and a lot easier to get the data types right when you work with pure code, it is not impossible to do so in the Object Oriented world either.Start with defining a ubiquitous language for the domain, design your models based on the domain of the problem you are trying to solve and don’t shy away from refactoring your code if it doesn’t make sense to you after a week of writing it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some examples of data-types that are easy to get wrong:      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;      phone_number : Number
         book_ISBN : Number
        start_date : String
         area_code : Number
 record_identifier : Number
       temperature : Number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The temperature as Number is a bit tricky, since while you can compare 2 different temperature measure, adding them does not make much sense. I would typically create a type alias for such a field.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some simple rules that are good to keep in mind:
Always assign data-type based on the operations allowed on the values.Use alias to make things more intuitive, eg. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;first_name + last_name&lt;/code&gt; has no meaning so, define a data-type alias as such &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data Name = String&lt;/code&gt;
This would be a clever thing to do. Most functional languages have a clean way of defining such alias. Doing this for simple data-types in an Object Oriented language might feel like a pain though.Rule of thumb: Categorical data is never a Number! (caution: 0/1 can be both quantitative data or categorical data.)Rule of thumb: Look at what the aggregates on the data are possible - classification, averages, nothing. This is a good way to begin to understand what the data-type should be.If you are working on designing a model after looking at the raw data, do yourself a favor and ask for the meta-data instead. The meta on the data would tell you a lot more about it than the data itself (who would’ve thunk!)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lessons learned from a failed ‘pre-startup’]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/lessons-learned-from-a-failed-pre-startup</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/lessons-learned-from-a-failed-pre-startup</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2017 20:49:15 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, a friend has joined the startup wagon armed with a brilliant idea, execution capabilities and potential capital in angel investment money. I was sharing my own experiences with him and could trace out a few that might be worth a 10 minute read for anyone trying to be more productive - something that the act of starting a company certainly requires.I’ll just put them here in no particular order. Would love to see what you think, what your own experiences have been like.Work as a company not a personWhen you decide to start something tiny with the idea of making it big one day it is easy to still operate in the individual scheme of things. To see yourself (or a few other friends) as a company can be quite a challenge but, it is important that you define those boundaries for your time, resources and expenses. This would help you keep a track of things you are doing that align you more with the future that you visualize. It also helps by giving you a head start in figuring out what works for you as an organization and what does not.Take designated holidaysHolidays are not just a matter of HR policy, they are required by you to unwind and eventually be more productive. When you define on which days you can drink for long hours with your friends, on which days you can visit your parents, the days you can go on a boat ride, you’ll find that your ‘working’ days are more productive and there are lesser incentives for you to not give your 100% on the days that you are working. Document everything you do, say, think, talk about your projectOur minds are capable of painting very vivid, entertaining pictures of our ideas for us. Sadly, it is impossible to translate those ideas into tangible artifacts without a great deal of loss of details. The best we can do is make sure we describe our ideas and thoughts in the best possible way and keep doing that till our documentation reaches a maturity that we are satisfied with. Your ideas should be captured in such detail that if one decides to go though them they get a picture as close to what you have in mind as possible. There are caveats to this approach as well - it is possible to get stuck in a documentation quicksand. More details on effective documentation on some other day but, here’s a quick one - Don’t document thoughts as they come, you’ll throttle the flow by the
process of writing. Keep thinking about them and take a break after a
few hours before you write them down.Work with a traceability matrix in your documentAlmost everything you want to do would have a target audience and some expected effects that you want to bring about with your idea. So there would be a (measurable) effect that your implementation should bring about. In the frenzy of getting things done fast, it is easy to lose that focus. A simple act of making sure you trace each implementation detail to a point where you don’t lose focus is very important.Don’t overwork - It gives you reasons to take days offWhile working hard is important, what’s more critical is having a routine. If you work very hard, you would need to compensate by taking longer non-working breaks. These breaks do more harm than a regular routine that includes the visit to the badminton courts, a drink with your buddies and a Sunday morning run.HealthHopefully, I don’t need to convince you about this one. Health is important! Find an activity that you like to do and do it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[16 GB RAM Upgrade - Early 2011 MacBook Pro]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/16-gb-ram-upgrade-early-2011-macbook-pro</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/16-gb-ram-upgrade-early-2011-macbook-pro</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2017 03:39:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Sierra upgrade had not been very kind on my old laptop, an early 2011 MacBook Pro. It came with an i5 Intel processor but just 4 GB of RAM (and the fact that it has a 320 GB SATA disk didn’t help the cause for a machine that could actually be used for anything productive at all). RAM upgrade was the obvious first choice after viewing the results from vm_stat (that’s vmstat on the Mac terminal) that were showing a very high number of Pageouts - meaning that the RAM was not enough to store all the pages of memory required by the OS and applications which made the OS swap out existing pages into the secondary memory (it being SATA killed speed).So yeah, long story short, I upgraded to 16 GB (against the guidelines provided by Apple on this issue for my generation of laptop) and I can see 0 pageout and a visibly fast machine. I can switch between open projects in Eclipse and GarageBand, listen to music while editing this post. Might not sound like much to ya’ll but, to me it is close to discovering inter-dimensional space travel portal gun in this age of mediocre earth transportation.Next saving goes into investing on an SSD storage. I wonder if I can get rid of the monstrous Optical Drive and have an SSD instead. Would make my laptop a lot lighter and lightening fast!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Johannes Gutenberg: The Birth of Movable Type]]></title><description><![CDATA[German inventor Johannes Gutenberg developed a method of movable type and used it to create one of the western world’s first major printed books, the “Forty–Two–Line” Bible.]]></description><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/the-birth-of-movable-type/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/the-birth-of-movable-type/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;German inventor Johannes Gutenberg developed a method of movable type and used it to create one of the western world’s first major printed books, the “Forty–Two–Line” Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg&lt;/strong&gt; (c. 1398 – 1468) was a German blacksmith, goldsmith, printer, and publisher who introduced printing to Europe. His invention of mechanical movable type printing started the Printing Revolution and is widely regarded as the most important event of the modern period. It played a key role in the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Scientific revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Johannes Gutenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his invention of the printing press, Gutenberg was the first European to use movable type printing, in around 1439. Among his many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based ink; and the use of a wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw presses of the period. His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike. Gutenberg’s method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a type metal alloy and a hand mould for casting type. The alloy was a mixture of lead, tin, and antimony that melted at a relatively low temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast well, and created a durable type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information — including revolutionary ideas — transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-nationalism, accelerated by the flowering of the European vernacular languages to the detriment of Latin’s status as lingua franca. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale, while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of movable type was a marked improvement on the handwritten manuscript, which was the existing method of book production in Europe, and upon woodblock printing, and revolutionized European book-making. Gutenberg’s printing technology spread rapidly throughout Europe and later the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His major work, the Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Printing Press&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 1439, Gutenberg was involved in a financial misadventure making polished metal mirrors (which were believed to capture holy light from religious relics) for sale to pilgrims to Aachen: in 1439 the city was planning to exhibit its collection of relics from Emperor Charlemagne but the event was delayed by one year due to a severe flood and the capital already spent could not be repaid. When the question of satisfying the investors came up, Gutenberg is said to have promised to share a “secret”. It has been widely speculated that this secret may have been the idea of printing with movable type. Also around 1439–1440, the Dutch Laurens Janszoon Coster came up with the idea of printing. Legend has it that the idea came to him “like a ray of light”.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Early wooden printing press as depicted in 1568.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until at least 1444 he lived in Strasbourg, most likely in the St. Arbogast parish. It was in Strasbourg in 1440 that Gutenberg is said to have perfected and unveiled the secret of printing based on his research, mysteriously entitled Kunst und Aventur (art and enterprise). It is not clear what work he was engaged in, or whether some early trials with printing from movable type may have been conducted there. After this, there is a gap of four years in the record. In 1448, he was back in Mainz, where he took out a loan from his brother-in-law Arnold Gelthus, quite possibly for a printing press or related paraphernalia. By this date, Gutenberg may have been familiar with intaglio printing; it is claimed that he had worked on copper engravings with an artist known as the Master of Playing Cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1450, the press was in operation, and a German poem had been printed, possibly the first item to be printed there. Gutenberg was able to convince the wealthy moneylender Johann Fust for a loan of 800 guilders. Peter Schöffer, who became Fust’s son-in-law, also joined the enterprise. Schöffer had worked as a scribe in Paris and is believed to have designed some of the first typefaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;All that has been written to me about that marvelous man seen at Frankfurt is true. I have not seen complete Bibles but only a number of quires of various books of the Bible. The script was very neat and legible, not at all difficult to follow—your grace would be able to read it without effort, and indeed without glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;footer&gt;
			&lt;cite&gt;—Future pope Pius II in a letter to Cardinal Carvajal, March 1455&lt;/cite&gt;
		&lt;/footer&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg’s workshop was set up at Hof Humbrecht, a property belonging to a distant relative. It is not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this he borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in 1452. At the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars). There is also some speculation that there may have been two presses, one for the pedestrian texts, and one for the Bible. One of the profit-making enterprises of the new press was the printing of thousands of indulgences for the church, documented from 1454–55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1455 Gutenberg completed his 42-line Bible, known as the Gutenberg Bible. About 180 copies were printed, most on paper and some on vellum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Court Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time in 1456, there was a dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, and Fust demanded his money back, accusing Gutenberg of misusing the funds. Meanwhile the expenses of the Bible project had proliferated, and Gutenberg’s debt now exceeded 20,000 guilders. Fust sued at the archbishop’s court. A November 1455 legal document records that there was a partnership for a “project of the books,” the funds for which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to Fust. The court decided in favor of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop and half of all printed Bibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Gutenberg was effectively bankrupt, but it appears he retained (or re-started) a small printing shop, and participated in the printing of a Bible in the town of Bamberg around 1459, for which he seems at least to have supplied the type. But since his printed books never carry his name or a date, it is difficult to be certain, and there is consequently a considerable scholarly debate on this subject. It is also possible that the large Catholicon dictionary, 300 copies of 754 pages, printed in Mainz in 1460, may have been executed in his workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Fust–Schöffer shop was the first in Europe to bring out a book with the printer’s name and date, the Mainz Psalter of August 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Later Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1462, during a conflict between two archbishops, Mainz was sacked by archbishop Adolph von Nassau, and Gutenberg was exiled. An old man by now, he moved to Eltville where he may have initiated and supervised a new printing press belonging to the brothers Bechtermünze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1465, Gutenberg’s achievements were recognized and he was given the title Hofmann (gentleman of the court) by von Nassau. This honor included a stipend, an annual court outfit, as well as 2,180 litres of grain and 2,000 litres of wine tax-free. It is believed he may have moved back to Mainz around this time, but this is not certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg died in 1468 and was buried in the Franciscan church at Mainz, his contributions largely unknown. This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg’s grave is now lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of typography in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig. It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleon’s biography of famous Germans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Printing Method With Movable Type&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg’s early printing process, and what tests he may have made with movable type, are not known in great detail. His later Bibles were printed in such a way as to have required large quantities of type, some estimates suggesting as many as 100,000 individual sorts. Setting each page would take, perhaps, half a day, and considering all the work in loading the press, inking the type, pulling the impressions, hanging up the sheets, distributing the type, etc., it is thought that the Gutenberg–Fust shop might have employed as many as 25 craftsmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg’s technique of making movable type remains unclear. In the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe. Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or a somewhat primitive version has been the subject of considerable debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the standard process of making type, a hard metal punch (made by punchcutting, with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a softer copper bar, creating a matrix. This is then placed into a hand-held mould and a piece of type, or “sort”, is cast by filling the mould with molten type-metal; this cools almost at once, and the resulting piece of type can be removed from the mould. The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or fonts. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type-cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times. The sorts can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of “movable type”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invention of the making of types with punch, matrix and mold has been widely attributed to Gutenberg. However, recent evidence suggests that Gutenberg’s process was somewhat different. If he used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been nearly identical, with some variations due to miscasting and inking. However, the type used in Gutenberg’s earliest work shows other variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams… Through it, god will spread his word.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;footer&gt;
			&lt;cite&gt;—Johannes Gutenberg&lt;/cite&gt;
		&lt;/footer&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, the physicist Blaise Agüera y Arcas and Princeton librarian Paul Needham, used digital scans of a Papal bull in the Scheide Library, Princeton, to carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in different parts of the printed text. The irregularities in Gutenberg’s type, particularly in simple characters such as the hyphen, suggested that the variations could not have come from either ink smear or from wear and damage on the pieces of metal on the types themselves. While some identical types are clearly used on other pages, other variations, subjected to detailed image analysis, suggested that they could not have been produced from the same matrix. Transmitted light pictures of the page also appeared to reveal substructures in the type that could not arise from traditional punchcutting techniques. They hypothesized that the method may have involved impressing simple shapes to create alphabets in “cuneiform” style in a matrix made of some soft material, perhaps sand. Casting the type would destroy the mould, and the matrix would need to be recreated to make each additional sort. This could explain the variations in the type, as well as the substructures observed in the printed images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, they feel that “the decisive factor for the birth of typography”, the use of reusable moulds for casting type, might have been a more progressive process than was previously thought. They suggest that the additional step of using the punch to create a mould that could be reused many times was not taken until twenty years later, in the 1470s. Others have not accepted some or all of their suggestions, and have interpreted the evidence in other ways, and the truth of the matter remains very uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster in the 1430s and may have brought some of his equipment from Haarlem to Mainz. While Coster appears to have experimented with moulds and castable metal type, there is no evidence that he had actually printed anything with this technology. He was an inventor and a goldsmith. However, there is one indirect supporter of the claim that Coster might be the inventor. The author of the Cologne Chronicle of 1499 quotes Ulrich Zell, the first printer of Cologne, that printing was performed in Mainz in 1450, but that some type of printing of lower quality had previously occurred in the Netherlands. However, the chronicle does not mention the name of Coster, while it actually credits Gutenberg as the “first inventor of printing” in the very same passage (fol. 312). The first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471, and the Coster connection is today regarded as a mere legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19th century printer and typefounder Fournier Le Jeune suggested that Gutenberg might not have been using type cast with a reusable matrix, but possibly wooden types that were carved individually. A similar suggestion was made by Nash in 2004. This remains possible, albeit entirely unproven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also been questioned whether Gutenberg used movable types at all. In 2004, Italian professor Bruno Fabbiani claimed that examination of the 42-line Bible revealed an overlapping of letters, suggesting that Gutenberg did not in fact use movable type (individual cast characters) but rather used whole plates made from a system somewhat like a modern typewriter, whereby the letters were stamped successively into the plate and then printed. However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weekend Hack - Face Recognition based Access Control System with Python, OpenCV and Rekognition]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/weekend-hack-face-recognition-based-access</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/weekend-hack-face-recognition-based-access</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 03:26:05 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My current interest in ML has triggered an urge to revive my Python skills. A good start, I thought, could be experimenting with some Image Processing - mostly to understand the limitations and challenges of tasks like these. The last time I worked with Image Processing was as part of a PoC for Hadoop. I used HIPI to do the heavy lifting of creating image bundles and preparing them for the underlying HDFS with OpenCV’s java bindings to detect faces using Haar cascades.The problem statement for this hack extends my experiment with HIPI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Problem Statement:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detect human faces on a video feed and compare the captured faces against an image dataset to suggest probable matches to provide access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Technology/Tool/Environment Stack:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 2.7.x
opencv python
OSX Sierra
AWS Rekocnition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation of OpenCV is a major pain! Especially if you wish to work with Videos on Sierra. Most of my time was spent in preparing the workstation with a reliable installation of OpenCV (unsuccessful attempts included installing a pip package that claimed to provide OpenCV but was compiled without ffmpeg). As of now this post[link missing] is the most reliable source of instructions to install OpenCV on Sierra (and incredibly detailed). I would not reproduce any steps from that guide to avoid redundancy.
You might want to check this[link missing] guide out if you are new to setting up virtualenv for python development:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Solution:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution revolves around breaking the problem down into smaller tasks that are more or less self contained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture frames of a video (in my case this was a video feed from my internal facetime camera).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect human faces in the captured frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a datastore of known faces (this involves mapping a person with a set of features extracted from their face).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Match the captured frame against the face datastore to grant access or deny it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capturing frames from a video feed:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this with python is quite straight forward. OpenCV has &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;VideoCapture( )&lt;/code&gt; that gives you a handle on the video. It takes one argument - the identifier for the camera - if you have a single camera, as was my case, just pass a 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detecting human faces in the captured frame:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this exercise I was not interested in training the classifier. There are very efficient Haar cascade classifiers that give great accuracy. OpenCV comes equipped with trained classifiers that we would leverage (there are some cool ones that let you identify cats in images too!)The Haar cascade classifier that I used was:opencv/data/haarcascades/haarcascade&lt;em&gt;frontalface&lt;/em&gt;default.xml
Working with gray-scale images is faster so we convert the captured frame to gray, create a classifier that can identify a human face in an image (you might have to tweak the classifier to suite your case) and, pass the gray-scale image to it which would return a list of faces it identifies.I did have to tweak the parameters based on the distance of the camera from the subject, etc. but, it worked well for most parts. It indicated positive results even when the subject was moving fast in front of the camera - it pointed the blurred human face in that case (might not always be what you want - my app breaks in such situations as of now!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Face datastore:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter AWS Rekognition!Rekognition lets you create a Collection of faces that you can match against. The API is straight forward. One important point to note is that AWS does not store the actual image bytes just an incredibly rich set of features that it associates with the face by giving it a faceId. You can keep adding new faces to this collection by calling the rekognitionClient.index_faces( ) API (I’m using the python sdk - boto3).You would need to map the returned faceId (and other face metadata) to the actual image of the person or some other identifier for the person and persist it.Match captured face against the face datastore:Rekognition has a face matching API that takes the CollectionId and image frame and returns the metadata associated with the matched face from the collection (or a no match). A list of matched faces with confidence level is returned in decreasing order of confidence.If more than one face is detected in the input image, only the largest face is matched.So there you have it! It is ridiculously easy to build this solution as a PoC. Taking this to production should still not be a very daunting task, it would just take more time to visualize all failure scenarios and account for them.Here’s the code produced as part of this short hack exercise:&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/prasoonj/tzukuruPlaces&quot;&gt;https://github.com/prasoonj/tzukuruPlaces&lt;/a&gt;
where I was lazy:- The project structure could be a lot better.- I’m using Mac’s ‘say “Hello World”’ terminal command to announce the name of the person matched (also to produce some delay giving better user interaction). This can certainly be done in a much better way.- There are a lot of scenarios where the app fails right now. No exception handling is done.- Unit tests!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Notes on DynamoDB’s data model and partitioning strategy]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/notes-on-dynamodb-data-model-and-partitioning</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/notes-on-dynamodb-data-model-and-partitioning</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2017 01:26:41 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DynamoDB is a fast, scaleable, managed document store from Amazon Web Services. Be sure to check it out if you have not done so already before starting with this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing a schema for a document store is remarkably different from a traditional relational data store. Most document/NoSQL persistence solutions sell their product with a tag line that often says - &lt;em&gt;“Store anything in any schema”&lt;/em&gt; but, the truth is a lot different. While a NoSQL document store does not expect you to follow a particular structure for each record (beyond the presence of a primary key), the reality is that if you don’t think through the design of your tables and the documents stored in them, you won’t be ale to go beyond a trivial =&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the humble scope of this blog, I won’t be able to cover all design aspects of a document store. Let’s limit our coverage to trying to achieve an understanding of the DynamoDB’s data model and, how the schema design would affect the service availability and cost for your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at how DynamoDB distributes the throughput that you assign to each of your tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you allocate throughput T to a table (which is what you pay for!) it would be divided evenly over all the partitions that the table has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DyanmoDB is a managed service that promises a robust ‘scale-out’ mechanism to handle increased data load which means that the number of partitions would keep increasing as your table grows to accommodate more data. Each record for a given table has to have a primary key: a combination of a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hashKey&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;partitionKey&lt;/code&gt; and an optional &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rangeKey&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sortKey&lt;/code&gt;. The partitionKey (PK) is given to the dynamoDB’s hashing function that decides which partition it would be a part of (and consequently where to look for a particular record). Records with the same PK but a different RangeKey (RK) sit in the same partition in an order defined by the natural ordering of the RK.The hashing function of DyanmoDB tries to ensure that the records are evenly distributed across all partitions of the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In designing your DynamoDB schema, a rule of thumb is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data access should be as evenly spread across all partitions as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider 2 scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario 1:
You are storing user details for a social networking website where all users are equally likely to request for the user resource over their lifetime of usage of the service. A perfectly valid choice for a PK in this case would be the userId. The hashing function would ensure that users are evenly spread across all partitions and the nature of your application and this particular data has a similar access pattern making your design rather simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario 2:
You want to store user history which would be used to pick the most recent user interactions to be displayed in a ticker. If we use the same strategy and persist the records with userId as PK, we would end up with a lot of ‘historical’ partitions that are very rarely or never accessed. Can’t be very bad, you’d say.Let’s look at what happens to the throughput of the table. As we saw earlier, the total throughput assigned to a table is evenly divided between all the partitions - restricting the maximum throughput to T/n on each partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(T := total&lt;em&gt;throughput, n := total&lt;/em&gt;number&lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt;partitions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are essentially wasting a lot of dollars on throughput that you would never use! Your dynamoDB access would show throttling even though you see a lot of unused throughput for your table!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For such ‘time-series’ data a good strategy is to age out old data in tables with limited throughput and provide more throughput to ‘hot data’ that’s contained in time sensitive tables -  create new tables with higher throughput for hot data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick recap and some important considerations:Throughput should be spread ONLY across frequently accessed data.A good way to show that the design has inherent weaknesses is to look for ‘scan’ operations over ‘query’. If your design requires a scan, there’s something wrong!DynamoDB automatically adds more partitions to your table as the data size grows, dividing the total throughput evenly across all of them.There might be a need to breakdown requests into smaller sizes - a query/scan that returns a massive response is bound to consume a major chunk of the allotted throughput and as a result throttle the database for other queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR
Be very careful when designing a schema for storing time-series data in dynamoDB. Ensure that the assigned throughput is spread across all partitions containing ‘hot-data’ and is not wasted on partitions that are rarely used. Ensure that the data access pattern matches the hashing function - access should be evenly distributed over all partitions of the table.Create new tables with higher throughput in case of data that has a decline in usage as it ages.&lt;/p&gt;

I think there’s no place where a company like Apple can hide for something as sloppy as this. A small sample survey that I did on this subject with people around me indicated that the problem is not isolated to my handset. (Apple - 0, LowestOrderSchmuck - 1)- A teammate lost a day’s worth of work when Sierra’s first update came out. The system crashed and nothing would bring it back other than a complete re-install of the OS. I’ve been forced to stay on El Capitan even after more than 6 months of the latest version being out. I don’t think I have the nerves or the motivation to land myself in muck voluntarily.Anyway, let’s put that negativity behind us and talk about the uber-cool migration tool that comes with apple by default - no third-party integration, no version mismatch issues, no spilling hot coffee on the vulnerable parts of your body - just the sheer joy of connect-click-migrate!Just connect your new machine to your old one (over a wired or wireless network), open the Migration-Assistant in both the machines and follow the onscreen instructions. It is as simple as that! The most natural, unadulterated joy I experienced on Apple after a lifetime of pain and disappointment. (In case you are wondering why I am on a Mac in the first place, well, sometimes we have to go down the dirty path for a living!)The whole process took under 40 minutes and for my mac:MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)2.2 GHz Intel Core i716 GB 1600 MHz DDR3Oh yeah, before we close, if you migrate from an old machine to a new one and don’t intend to use the old machine, always try:sudo rm -rf /(Watching things burn like that is like sitting in a huge room filled with bubble-wrap!)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dropwizard Upgrade 0.6 to 0.9]]></title><description><![CDATA[Upgrading from Dropwizard version 0.6 to 0.9 was not a very smooth process for me.

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other things that were not covered or well defined in the guide that, along with the guide, should be sufficient to help you upgrade to a more recent version of Dropwizard -Server configuration:If you have been using the same port for application and admin endpoints in the previous versions, with the upgrade you would get a Bind exception. In the earlier version if the same port is given Dropwizard would automatically use the same for admin endpoints and expose them at /admin. The documentation around this is not very clear but in such a case you would need to use the “simple” server type which would take just a single port.Views:If your application uses Dropwizard views, after upgrade you would need to include a dropwizard-views-freemarker dependency which was previously included in the core artifacts. Failing to include this would just give a vague “Template Error” and not stacktrace.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Leadership Goals]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/leadership-goals</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/leadership-goals</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2016 02:51:11 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk a little about leadership. Everyone hopes for a good
leader to guide them in their formative years and aspires to be a worthy
one themselves when the time is right. There could be several
definitions of ‘worthy’ - be in a position to be able to provide help to
people around, assume a position of unquestionable power, be immortal in some sense of the world - so we will skip talking about it.I
have a few of my own ideas on this subject - most of them validated by
my personal experiences, some validated by a strong conviction to agree
with my own thought process that suggests that these HAVE TO BE TRUE (if
my cognitive bias is blurring my thoughts please do write to me).This is what I think a good leader should try to do:Provide vision and general direction and then let the team take an organic path depending on the team dynamics.
The initial few interactions are a time for everyone in the team to
understand the others and form the initial set of expectations from one
another. Even in a group where everyone knows everyone else, embarking
upon a new project can always expose new areas of interests and
conflicts. It is important for the team to cope with diversity of
thoughts, ideas and people and a good leader enunciates the benefits of
this ‘self-discovery’ of the team dynamics by each of the team members. A team that shares a pizza is bound to have lesser communication barriers when they work together.Define policies and processes based on the dynamics that surface due to the interaction between team members.
Instead of forcing a structure of rules and processes on the team, try
to learn from the way the team interactions take shape and don’t shy
away from making drastic changes to processes that have in fact worked
for you in the past. Think of your team as a graph with each node
attached to every other node through a unique relationship - for a team
of 10 people that would be (10*9)/2 = 45. Each of these relationships
add an idiosyncrasy to the team composition and dynamics. Each team is
different from every other team and what works for one would not work
for the other in exactly the same way. Be ready to experiment with your
ideas.Instrumented leadership to gather progress metrics, gauge general direction of the team while keeping away from micromanagement.
A team is a living organism that provides very informative insights
into its own functioning. Get into the habit of collecting valuable
information about the team’s performance on areas that you feel are
important. It could be simple metrics like how often has a sub-task
shared by 2 or more people from the team been done as per your
expectations and how often has it suffered because of the task
assignment, composition of the team, etc. Measurement is important
because everyone would have their unique way of handling a challenge,
what works for one might not work for the other and a thorough
examination and validation by means of statistical analysis can refine
the task assignment process. You could capture, for example, the nature
of task, members involved, task completion details, number of conflicts
arising during the task (asking team members to submit a work-log entry
with fields like “Was the day productive? (Yes/No/Partially)”, etc. can
provide some initial sparks for the larger task of gathering team
performance related metrics (more on this in a later post).Clear roadblocks and point out future blocks and bottlenecks based on experience and inspection of gathered team metrics.
The metrics that you have been capturing would certainly provide some
sense of direction - Are tasks getting closed as per expectations of
timelines and quality? Do team members feel more enthusiastic to work
with a certain set of employees than the others? What can be said about
favored tasks and favored team members? - The more observant you are,
the better the chances of finding the sweet spot of maximum efficiency.
Remember that as a team leader your job is to ensure that people are
happy in their engagement with you and the team. While nothing
replaces a keen watch on the efforts that the team has been putting,
never get into the habit of micro-management. Treat your teammates the
way prison inmates are treated at your own risk. Think of this as an
opportunity to find out more about the people you work with - be
genuinely interested in their personal and professional growth. Make
the team feel that they are responsible to a great extent not just for
providing manpower and skill sets but even for the direction that the
product takes over the course of time. Ownership is always an
illusion in a professional setup. That being said, the best way to
define ownership I believe is to have a person responsible for the
setbacks and celebrations resulting from their actions and efforts.
Since both “setback” and “celebration” are more or less just social
constructs with the central idea that making incremental increase in the
reputation one holds in the society would result in direct or indirect
benefits one gets and increase the chances of a ‘better life’, these can play a very important part in promoting ownership of the project that the team is working on. Take measures to limit the fear of failure on an individual level. People
are more creative when their heads are not always on the line.
Creativity is difficult. A number of researches point out that a
constant fear of failure can harm creative thinking in the long run. It
might be a good idea to push for better results but, find ways for
saying it in such a way that the team feels a need to succeed rather
than a need to not fail. A lot of bad things happen when we fail and our
mind is wired to focus on those more than the things that go relatively
well. Assuring your team of a reasonable and unbiased assessment in
case of failure and getting them excited about winning can make a big
difference.Assume the position of accountability so that the rest of the team has lesser pressure to deal with.
It is important that the team feels protected from outside pressures
and has faith in your capabilities to rescue them when the tides are
going against them. No one respects a leader who runs away from a
battle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How much process is too much process?!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/how-much-process-is-too-much-process</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/how-much-process-is-too-much-process</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2016 21:06:23 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is easy to get delusional about the value that processes defined in a project add to it. There are just 3 types of people in a project - ones that swear by process, ones that hate all aspects of it and ones that follow without ever questioning anything about it. Here’s my 2 cents on what goes wrong and how to stop it from going wrong.Managers as process cops:I’ve seen so many managers beating down process down every developer’s throat without giving it any thought! Just like a typical cop who cares less about the legitimacy of a law and worries only about its enforcement, quite a few managers do not adapt a process for their team/project, they try to bend the team and the project to fit a process! I cannot tell you how terrible this could be within the limits of a humble blog post! Here, let me say it out loud: Don’t be sheep! Think of areas where following a particular process is harming your project and/or team members and change the things that are being done accordingly. Each time you fail to do this your teams productivity would suffer. Sometimes, it would be impossible to capture this loss of productivity by the metrics that you are looking at since the process does not allow you to go beyond those data points - it’s like being trapped in a matrix!Is your process eating into developer time?A classic example is a lead engineer spending 1 hour everyday on putting a report together that could be easily avoided if all the stakeholders agreed on one tool and are ready to look at the report that the tool generates instead of expecting an excel sheet embedded in an email!This happens so often, different stakeholders would require different metrics and reports and would be very rigid in the presentation of these metrics. The rule should be simple: if a particular report has to be generated on a regular basis, automate the report generation or capture it in a dashboard that they have access to. Excel sheets are a great tool as well but, manually entering data points into a sheet after pulling it from a tool is the most awful waste of resources!Prefer Hygiene over Process!A better way to get people to do the expected thing is to make it part of the hygiene that’s baked into the culture of your team. Following a clean process should be as intuitive as writing proper comments in the code base. How you ‘enforce’ it is completely dependent on how the team dynamics work! I would say that you should not try and enforce it after all. Demonstrate why a process point is a good idea and increases individual productivity and team performance and people would adopt it. For instance, documenting the ticket tracker with essential information about the task one is working on can cut down on multiple mails flowing around and scattered information. Explore process automationIf you sincerely look for automation opportunities within your processes you’d be surprised how a small one time effort can free a lot of time and get rid of process compliance issues! Be open to feedbackPeople who are responsible for defining processes and other process owners need to be open to constructive feedback (make them read articles like these!)If one is too busy to listen to people one is working with/for one might as well not work with them! Having said that, I would love to hear from you :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instructions To Set Up GIT User]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/instructions-to-set-up-git-user</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/instructions-to-set-up-git-user</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 22:17:49 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’m responsible for on-boarding new users to use our local git repositories at work.

I’ve taken their service and it is just great - no hassles, no rush, you can track your ride, there is no annoying music playing, just you and your favorite book while you zip through the infamous traffic of the city.But, let’s see what they are competing with - EVERY OTHER TRANSPORT MECHANISM ON THE ROAD!

I bought a 22in AOC Monitor (it happens to be an Android device as well - would try to do a review of its capabilities soon). Like any other human being of the modern era, I did some research online but, didn’t find anything that could compete with the deal that my friendly local dealer offered (SP Road, Bangalore is a multi-billion dollar market believe it or not!). So, I went ahead and bought the monitor in ‘offline mode’ with no records of the purchase with any e-commerce website.
The Amazons of the Internet world did not see this deal happen in a direct way so they continued to push me stale offers. Every website I visit has a big banner tying to sell me a monitor! Quite obviously, things are broken!
Something similar happened when I bought a dress as a gift for my niece. The recommendation engine failed to see why I would not want to buy a dress every week!A typical recommendation engine works something like this:Step 1. Tap on a customer”s browsing history.
Step 2. Try to look for ‘recommendations’ that can be suggested -     some obvious ones, some related items, some up-sells.
This standard approach is broken at many levels.While there are major efforts to integrate a customer’s details to create a single-view across different platforms, it remains isolated. Challenges are fair - mining massive datasets is required across a plethora of services, people often lie on social media about true choices, activities happening offline are completely ignored and many more.What can be done?Creating a multi-layered recommendation is important (I don’t have an analytics background so my terminology would be shaky, sorry). Capture the purchases, capture the things one would do with those purchases, capture events that could be a result of the purchase (A tweet - “Coffee, music and Kindle - perfect morning!” after a week long “coffee maker discounts” search history has to tell you more!).Human beings have a lot of things to tell us, one just needs the right machines listening to them!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Don’t Waste Your Next Interview Opportunity!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/dont-waste-your-next-interview-opportunity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/dont-waste-your-next-interview-opportunity</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 04:24:44 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My organization is in a hiring overdrive these days. Each day some 10 candidates are interviewed or asked to write few lines of code as part of the elimination round. What that means for us is additional task of finding the people we want to work with along with regular work towards our deliverables!Though I’ve taken interviews in my previous organization, the sheer volume of candidates that I’m getting to meet now is a big learning experience. Sadly, all those who told you that very few people in the tech industry are employable were spot on about the state of affairs.As someone who’s ruined more than countable number of interviews for myself, I think I can give you a few things to think about before you suit-up for your next interview (please don’t wear a suit for a technical interview - on a completely unrelated, well almost, tangent read this!)#1. Run through the things you’ve done beforeI know, you want the interviewer to know that you know because you’ve done it in the past. But, truth be told, we don’t know. Unless there is something substantial that you can show us, we are not in a position to believe what you say - well, not always. So, always expect questions about the things that you say you’ve done. A good interviewer would know the right things to ask but, a lot of times, if the interviewer has not had experience with that particular technology, tool, etc. your failing to give prompt answers might lead her to think that you are hunting in the dark for answers.#2. Translate things at a fundamental levelWhatever your experience level, in a technical interview, no one is looking for your ability to spit ‘keywords’! It does sound harsh but, I’ve seen so many candidates throwing keywords and expecting to score well in a technical interview. If the interviewer asks you to showcase a good object oriented, scalable design for an ATC system and gives you enough time to solve the problem, don’t talk in terms of ‘black-boxes’ of functionality alone. Write down a few interfaces, demonstrate how the entities are related, possibly write pseudo code for a module that you think would require some complex treatment. If the interviewer does not want you to go into such detail, she would guide you to abstract certain layers. Don’t make that assumption yourself.#3. No one has all the time in the world for youTake your time to settle down, drink water, visit the facilities and be at comfort. But, when it comes down to business, don’t beat around the bush. There are just 3 ways to answer a question - Give the right answer if you know it.Politely say that you don’t know the answer to the question.Say that you would keep it at the back of your head and provide the answer in case you are able to hit the nail in the head (again ask the interviewer if that’s fine).Talk about your best projects, favorite technologies, things you know best, your biggest tech-turn-ons first! If you think you are a nodejs ninja make sure you talk about it as soon as possible even if you are interviewing for a Java position (of course, don’t not talk about the technologies needed for the position you are applying for!)#4. Show the code!You are the code you write! (One of the best ways to evaluate those ‘self-improvement’ new year resolutions is to try and refactor the code that you wrote last year). If you have a public code repository, make sure that the interviewer has a look at it - insist that they do! It does not have to be contribution to the kernel that powers up Ex Machina, even the most humble library that you wrote would make a big difference. It goes to show that you are really passionate about technology, that when you go home after work, apart from playing with your dog, kids and wife (maybe, not in that order), you like to learn something new. Show them your github account, tech blog (could be as lousy as this one!), a project you did during vacations, anything that gives them an idea about you as a technology person.#5. Think aloud. Ask questions.I think most companies are steering clear of those (unproductive) puzzles - though, Don Knuth has a slightly different opinion about why puzzles are important for a computer scientist. But, even a simple question might involve something that you have not taken into account. Some simple aspect that you might have missed. For anything but a straight forward boolean-answer questions, practice to think aloud without sounding creepy - a few sessions with some close friends might be of help?If you have missed some important detail in your understanding of the question, the interviewer might fill you in on that or provide some clues to approach it better. Also, it helps for the interviewer to know how the candidate approaches the problem. That’s what you are being hired for after all - solving problems!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting (Most) Things Right In Modern Web Front-end Development.]]></title><description><![CDATA[This ancient opinion/guide would do you no good!]]></description><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/getting-most-things-right-in-modern-web</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/getting-most-things-right-in-modern-web</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 19:06:43 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We wold be creating an interest mapper webapp. Users of this app
would provide a bunch of things they are interested in and the tool will
(with some ML magic) find the people they should get in touch with. It
would also auto generate interactive dashboards for popular interests.[You
would require familiarity with a few things before you start here. In
most cases it would mean that you have the tool installed and know how
to put it to a very basic use:* nodeJs * npm (nodeJs’s package manager)(Be careful to install npm the right way! You should be able to install packages locally as well as globally (-g) without needing sudo privileges)]Let’s
get started by creating a directory for where our cool web-app will
reside. We will install the packages we need as we work our way through
this guide. $ mkdir find-my-buddy &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; cd find-my-buddyThe dependencies for the project can be defined in a “package.json” file within this directory and installed by:$ npm install # We would not be doing this though. We would install each package# as we find need for it. Just know that this is the standard way of# going about things. But, most of these packages are best installed# globally anyway.BowerPackage management on the front-end side of things is best done with Twitter’s Bower. Any front-end relevant artifact can be easily included in your project. If you have experience in back-end technologies you can compare it with Maven (for Java) or virtuanenv (for Python). It keeps packages local to the project - you can have the same dependency at different versions for different projects. This should not be a big surprise because the dependencies in a front-end project are tucked away in a folder specific to the project but, it is a cool parallel to the way things are done with packages that need to be installed with other technologies and one can easily create conflicts between system-wide installations and those required by a project having different versions.Here’s how things work:# Install bower using npm, our friendly package manager, globally$ npm install -g bowerWhen you install a package with bower it goes and sits neatly into “bower-components” directory, organized by the package names.Let’s try that out with the trusty and essential jquery library:# Make sure we are inside the project directory we created earlier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ bower install jquerybower cached        git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git#2.1.4bower validate      2.1.4 against git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git#&lt;em&gt;bower install       jquery#2.1.4jquery#2.1.4 bower&lt;em&gt;components/jquery#Let’s see what it did$ tree -L 3 ..`— bower&lt;/em&gt;components    &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-- jquery        |-- bower.json        |-- dist        |-- MIT-LICENSE.txt&lt;/code&gt;— src4 directories, 2 filesCouple of things that it did was to create a directory for all the packages that would be installed for the project - “bower-components” - and put the “jquery” component in there.Inside the “jquery” directory the contents are of interest that’ll help us understand the way things are organized using the best practices which we would use to organize our own project as welljquery # all files will reside under this component directory        |— bower.json # bower’s package file - more later        |— dist # directory containing all compiles resources        |— MIT-LICENSE.txt # duh!        `— src # sources used to build the ‘dist’ directory’s contents4 directories, 2 files When we build our project, our files will also go into the ‘dist’ directory too (at a different location of course).This is all sweet but, we don’t want to issue the install command repeatedly for each package we want to use. Also, we started off by saying this bower thing is a package manager so, let’s see how that works.# Again from inside the project directory$ bower init# This would initialize this project as a bower managed project# and create a bower.json file for you (after asking some very # useful questions. The bower.json would look like:{  name: ”find-my-buddy”,  version: ”0.0.0”,  description: ”Find your activity partner”,  authors: [    ”prasoonj”  ],  license: ”MIT”,  ignore: [    ”**/.&lt;/em&gt;”,    ”node&lt;em&gt;modules”,    ”bower&lt;/em&gt;components”,    ”test”,    ”tests”  ],  dependencies: {    jquery: ”~2.1.4”  }}You can even create this bower.json ‘by hand’ and work your way up. The “dependencies” section of the json is where we would define the packages that we require - along with their version numbers where necessary. Bower can work independently as a package manager for your project but, it’s real power is when used with other tools like Grunt, Yeoman, etc.Take a look at the API docs for bower to learn more. Most of the stuff there is for package publishers and you would probably not use it if you are just using bower to build a webapp the correct way.Let’s get a move on to other cool stuff.Grunt# Just like before, let’s start with installing this package with npm$ npm install -g grunt-cliGrunt-cli is not the grunt task runner!Okay, let’s step back a bit and see what grunt is and what it does. Grunt is a lot of things based on how you use it. In a nutshell, it is an automation framework for your front-end project that let’s you automate the common tasks that you would engage yourself with on a regular basis. The grunt ecosystem comprises of a bunch of awesome plugins that help you in this automation - compiling less scripts, starting a test server, running tests - all of this and more. If you don’t find what you are looking for, you can make your own plugins!After installing grunt-cli at a global level, you would have access to grunt command from any project. Executing grunt from a directory would look for a locally installed instance and take things forward. So, first step is to have a locally installed grunt task runner.# Let’s create a package.json file and provide ‘grunt’ as a # “devDependencies” so that node can install it. # We can create a package.json file “by hand” or use the uber-useful# utility - npm init$ npm init# A series of helper questions follow that guide you through the# process of providing values (with clever defaults) to the fields# of the final package.json file. The result in my case was:{  “name”: “find-my-buddy”,  “version”: “0.0.1”,  “description”: “Find your activity partner”,  “main”: “index.js”,  “scripts”: {    “test”: “echo ”Error: no test specified” &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; exit 1”  },  “author”: “smotchkiss”,  “license”: “MIT”}# Let’s install grunt locally for this project and add it as a # dependency to the package.json$ npm install grunt —save-dev# This would do two things - install ‘grunt’, creating node-modules# directory and add the grunt entry in the ‘devDependencies’ of # package.json. This is how the project looks like now:.|— bower&lt;em&gt;components|   `— jquery|— bower.json|— node&lt;/em&gt;modules|   &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-- grunt&lt;/code&gt;— package.json# And here’s the updated package.json{  “name”: “find-my-buddy”,  “version”: “0.0.1”,  “description”: “Find your activity partner”,  “main”: “index.js”,  “scripts”: {    “test”: “echo ”Error: no test specified” &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; exit 1”  },  “author”: “smotchkiss”,  “license”: “MIT”,  “devDependencies”: {    “grunt”: “^0.4.5”  }}From now on, we can just add the packages required by grunt to the package.json file and ask npm to install them for us if they are not already there using - npm install.Next, we need a gruntfile. We would not go into the details of the contents of the gruntfile beyond few essential things that we require. You can read more about it here: gruntfile introduction.Grunt would provide tasks that can be run on the project based on the plugins registered in the gruntfile. Let’s create a basic gruntfile and register a few plugins.The plugin that you register needs to be installed via npm first!# This is what our sample Gruntfile.js looks like. Ignore the details# for now. module.exports = function(grunt) {    //Importing project configuration from package.json    grunt.initConfig({        pkg: grunt.file.readJSON(”package.json”),        uglify: {            options: {                banner: ”/* &amp;#x3C;%= pkg.name %&gt; &amp;#x3C;%= grunt.template.today(“yyyy-mm-dd”) %&gt; */ \n”            },            build: {                src: ”src/&amp;#x3C;%= pkg.name %&gt;.js”,                dest: ”build/&amp;#x3C;%= pkg.name %&gt;.min.js”            }        }    });    //Load plugins    grunt.loadNpmTasks(”grunt-contrib-uglify”);    //Define default tasks    grunt.registerTask(”default”, [”uglify”]);};# The important parts of this file for now are the way we import # the configuration from package.json file, the way we register packages# and the way we define ‘defaults’.# Based on the packages registered in the Gruntfile, we would get a list# of ‘tasks’ that are available. The tasks defined as ‘default’ would be# performed automatically when ‘grunt’ command is used on the project.# To see a complete list of available tasks:$ grunt —helpThe utility of grunt would be visible when we include features in our project that require a regular ‘task’ to be performed - things like tests, compiling less files, etc.Let’s add a few bower components that we would be using to make the first cut of our app - angularjs, bootstrap.[My intention was to create one massive post that does a ‘start-to-finish’ of a web-app. Sadly, if I go that route, I would either be missing out the details that I want to provide for each component or would end up making this post one large monolith, adding to the already overflowing TL;DR guides. To ease that burden, I would cover angularjs and bootstrap in a future post (coming very soon - promise!)]# In the dependencies section of the bower.json file add the entries # for angularjs and bootstrapdependencies: {    jquery: ”~2.1.4”,    angular: ‘~1.4.3′,    bootstrap: ‘3.x.x’  }# Installing these is simple:$ bower installThis would create the required directories inside ‘bower-components’ and would ensure that we have all we need before we start out to see some angular magic on our bootstrap templates.You would notice that the angular directory has just the js files while the bootstrap directory has its own bower.json file, package.json file and a grunt task runner. This different is due to the fact that we would not be changing the code angularjs’s code, all our custom code would go into another package defining the logic of our application. However, even though we would not change the bootstrap css either, we would change one special less file there to include a single line to it so that our custom less code is compiled without interfering with the existing bootstrap classes (preserving the overrides that we would provide) and at the same time upgrading bootstrap would not wipe out the customizations that we have done. This would be a major hair-puller otherwise when you upgrade your bootstrap to a new version.[Wait for the future versions of this guide that would cover - angular, bootstrap, less, karma, jasmine and some basics of JavaScript that are required to understand how angular works]&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[De-Humanization!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/de-humanization</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/de-humanization</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 18:36:51 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If popular estimates are to be believed, the automation/robotics would make human beings (a majority of us!) unemployable in the next two decades. The question is not of ‘if’ anymore, it is an eventuality. While we must prepare for a situation like this, there is not much an individual can do. The preparation has to be a well orchestrated group effort involving governments, activists and organizations. Let’s first understand why individual effort would not be quite enough. While a few of us would be able to work hard enough, smart enough and be lucky enough to reach the place at the top of the ladder and steer clear from the automation ‘de-humanization’ in various work spaces, the competition would be crushing! You might as well prepare to be a celebrity, because just writing beautiful code or being a perfect tutor might not be enough - there would be millions more exactly like you competing for very very few spots!This is not going to be like the industrialization age where learning a new skill would help you save your job or proceed to a better one! The jobs won’t exists. Simple. It is tough if not impossible to prepare for a scenario like that!We’ve talked about this before! Let’s talk about what’s happening to mitigate the situation (at least for as many individuals as possible).There’s a movement, “Basic Income”, that aims to do a (minor) redistribution of wealth by making money available to individuals without expecting things in return. You provide money not because these individuals would give you (or someone else) anything in return, you provide them ‘basic’ income to take care of themselves. The interesting thing about this social movement is that it is not a government initiative. A bunch of people have come together, identified the problem that is about to hit us in future and have started constructing a plausible solution. Far from being perfect, I believe this movement would undergo several iterations. But, this is nevertheless a very good start.How does all this impact the social structure of the regions would be interesting to see (I can hardly wait to crawl inside a time-capsule and check out the exciting things that would change as a result). The basic needs would be provided by the governments of even under-developed societies - food, shelter. But, the idea of what are basic needs would also undergo a major change in the coming years. Even today access to Internet is considered a basic right (Facebook’s sham of a Internet.org aside, information access is of fundamental importance).An important argument to consider is that ‘greed’ is embedded in human nature. Consider this, the male counterpart is required to improve the gene pool. If there was no competition for the female, evolution would not be able to curtail the bad genes. That’s the place ‘want’ for a better wife, house, car, etc. emerges out of? Would the society, then, be ‘content’ with a ‘basic income’? I guess we would not know. Even if we do get a digital answer for this question, the politics of the world (and of our everyday lives) would not let us say it out loud and we’d keep trying to design better policies, formulate a modified socialist idea knowing all too well that they are doomed to fail.There’s also a brighter side (there must be many, I hope). An industry that would considerably benefit from the ‘de-humanization’ age would be the recruitment industry. Consider a situation where there were only a few people having a particular skill-set in a region. The companies looking for candidates would not have to approach any recruitment agency for that situation, they would reach out to the candidates directly (given they are not hiding under a rock while possessing market desirable skills!). They come into the picture when there are many people with desired skills hidden within a much greater pool. Each of them as good as the other, and several many promising to be better than them!We are entering an exciting era!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[03 - Fixing npm permissions | npm Documentation]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/undefined/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/undefined/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2015 22:38:02 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;03 - Fixing npm permissions | npm DocumentationThe place where all things npm are documented&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Multiple Moving Pieces]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/multiple-moving-pieces-software-design</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/multiple-moving-pieces-software-design</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 00:15:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brace yourselves, this is going to be a rather long post with many scenarios, several aspects and a lot of incremental change to each of them!Any moderately complex system would have multiple moving parts, multiple teams working in various combinations on those parts and each part progressing at it’s own pace. Project management then, is not simple task! (But, would you be weighed in gold for every paycheck if it was simple?!)Let’s consider this simple analogy - consider that you are a literature Nobel laureate writing her next best novel. A fiction piece that talks about how a town survived the attack of alien zombies! (Scary thought already right?) The basic story line is straight forward - the alien zombie attack is predicted by the oracle, a team of superheros is put together who orchestrate the ‘save the earth’ mission. Now, since you know a thing or two about fiction writing, you understand that the readers would already know that the book can be summarized in one line - “An army of alien zombies attack the earth, a group of superheros form a team to defeat them. Everyone lives happily, ever after.” The idea of writing this book is in the juice of the characters in it. As you go along telling the story, moving from event to event, you are evolving your characters. The two lead superheros are falling in love with each other, the two angry ones are coming to terms with working in the same team towards a common goal, the most powerful of them all has time to hone her skills that would be used in a sequel that you have planned but not announced! Above all, though all of them have their egos and problems, they must all finally come together and make each event of the story a success.As the author, your task is to make sure each element of the book moves in a specific direction, each character is brought up to speed to actuate an event as planned by you and each character is strong enough to etch its mark in the memory of the readers.Let’s get back to software development. Your task is just as complex (and artful) as of this author. You have a project to deliver that comprises of many moving parts, each of them have their own development timelines/issues, all of the moving parts must work together at each important juncture (call it releases or what you may).Primary considerationsIdentification of all moving parts - It is the first and most natural thing to do. Identify all the different components. I would suggest a pessimistic approach here. Divide as much as possible, it might be simpler to club a few together later on but, splitting a monolith is always going to be a challenge. Do not go by the teams that you have - for instance, if you have a bunch of web developers in a team there is no need to club a RESTful API and a web based front-end together. What if you decided to go mobile one day (even if this was something that was agreed upon as a ‘never gonna happen’ requirement). If a certain component is going to develop incrementally with requirement flowing in intermittently, see if the requirement gathering mechanism itself could be visualized as a component (this would be clear when we talk about interfaces and component interaction).Defining interfaces and interactions - Once components are on the board, it should be quite clear how they would interact with each other. Always follow the best practices for each component interface. There is a pattern for OO language interfaces that talks about “open close principle” which can be applied to our components here too - make each (published) component open for extension and closed for modification. Let’s take the case of a REST API; a requirement comes up that requires few more parameters for requesting an object from an endpoint - this new requirement should not break old functionality (you can version the API, use clever ways of making your API future proof, use good error/feedback mechanism to inform the consumer exactly what is missing, etc.) The interface contract between any two components has to be sacrosanct! Treat this as a protocol - spend a lot of time in considering all possible scenarios and freeze it before each component is developed! In a situation when this has to be changed, see if the open-close principle can be taken into account. Changing the way two pieces in a system interact should be taken as a serious design flaw. We talked about treating the requirement gathering mechanism as a distinct component, the thumb of rule could be - if the requirements are transient in nature, incremental and a specifications document is exposed to the development team, this document could serve as an interface between the business folk and the developers of this particular module (think of innovative ways in which this document can be included in an automation chain - avoid capturing such requirements in an spreadsheet!)Version control - This is probably the simplest thing to get wrong! The thumb rule here should be simple - each component should live in its own project that is capable of building an artifact independent of all other component. This would allow each component to evolve independent of the others, as long as the interfaces are strong and unchanging (and well documented) we’d all be a happy bunch. This is best understood by how things can go wrong - Imagine a project that is split into 2 parts: part one consists of pig scripts that carry out the ETCL for some data files, second part takes the transformed data and carries out MDM on it using different sources. If both these components are sitting in a single project, there would be no way to have a stable single version of the first component that can play with the other component. Each component is now tightly coupled with the other at the version control level even though they are separate units functionally and structurally! Bad design! The two components in all probability are developed by separate teams but this simple mistake requires that they are joined at the hip for all practical purposes!Traceability - The interfaces should either serve as traceability or should have a mapping to the traceability document/mechanism. In case any variation is detected from the traceability document, these would effect a change on the interfaces (less desired) in the worst case. A tight coupling/control over traceability and interfaces then becomes a necessity. There can be a simple rule - the interface should be modified structurally/functionally only when the change in requirements effect a change in the traceability document. In such a case, there larger project wide requirement would need to be broken down into component level traceability document elements which would eventually give a better control over the process and help in catch requirement related bugs very early in the development life cycle (even if you follow a non-agile or a semi-agile methodology).There is a standard pattern to go about this that you must look into - hexagonal architecture. Here, there is essentially a ‘core’ of the project on top of which the different teams place ‘enhancements’ and ‘interactions’. If a specific ‘core’ is not entirely visible or even applicable in your case, you can consider this core to be an agreed upon set of protocols or a common point where most components meet and which remains sacrosanct for all practical purposes. You can think of that as a central port/adapter. It could even be a traceability document!(I would love to evolve, improve and correct this post with your inputs. Do comment or mail me your thoughts.)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Here's How The 'Hours of Work' Is a Flawed Idea In a Creative Environment.]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/heres-how-hours-of-work-is-a-flawed-idea-creativity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/heres-how-hours-of-work-is-a-flawed-idea-creativity</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2015 21:24:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, work (and hence remuneration for that work) has been measured in the time spent in doing a certain work. The hourly rate itself would depend on how much value that type of work carries, the level of skill of the doer, the scarcity of the type of labor (and sometimes, how strong a personal bond exists between the doer of work and the person responsible for remuneration).To understand how this came to being and to be able to evaluate if this is the right way to go about things, it is important that we visit the history behind the practice first.When human beings were hunters and gatherers, the average work week was less than 10 hours! Very erratic in nature and quite versatile, it was not something that could lead to or support a thriving economy and development. The age of industrialization saw standardization of working hours (and a drastic increase in them). The machinery was in place, the more hours it ran, the more the production and with artificial lighting available to light the dark side of the 24 hour day, there was no reason why it should not! There were visionaries like Henry Ford who advocated a much shorter work week postulating that it was not just better for the employee and inline with employee welfare but, better for the economy in general because shorter week gave the workers time to consume without which production was useless.So, that was the general idea which remains more or less the same today. The average working hours have reduced drastically over the past 60 years with few countries clocking as low as 21 hours a week of work (Netherlands duh! but, countries like France are not far behind) yet incentives like 150% remuneration for ‘overtime’ get people to work more (at least in countries with less power distance index where justification is required from the superiors for working extra and is not taboo to question a late night stay at work, etc.). This is due to several reasons which we shall not go into here.The point to note in all of this is that this is an idea borrowed and extended from the industrial realm - a place where labor is just that, labor! The machines are put in place and the presence of humans on the assembly line is quite mechanical in itself. ”Skill’ is a mere exposure to the work environment directly proportional to the time one spends on the machine. Not far away from say the modern day IT service industries in the third world.However, there is a stark difference between the two - the mechanized industry labor and IT industry labor. The IT industry produce is not limited by the rate at which a particular assembly line operates. It is indeed possible that the produce from an IT industry can be quantified in more than just hours of work! Every piece of work can have an associated value to it that results in the success of the company or the client and that’s how the worth of an employee should be measured - the value of the deliverable produced by the employee.Benefits of the approachA motivated employee with more skills would get more done in the regular working hours and her remuneration linked to that quantifiable work would eliminate the need for lousy bell-curves and associated employee frustration.With a larger variable component in the compensation the employers would pay only for what work gets done above a basic minimum payout.This promotes a healthy accountability for work and encourages ownership. When adopted within an open environment it can work wonders!Would drive employees to be more efficient in their work. Drive them to automating tasks, getting work done in smarter ways, cutting down on time to develop a module because (surprise!) the time is not a factor in compensation!Implementation Implementation, as in any other case of adopting new approach, can be challenging. The anchor point of the implementation could be the estimation that going into every project. A regular estimation document talks about effort required for a job - measured in units of time. Use the same document to translate this ”effort’ to the work-hours calculation that your establishment uses.A more efficient employee is then free to utilize the ”extra’ time in ways she deems fit - personal development (for example learning a new technology that would benefit the employers eventually), taking care of her personal affairs, etc. resulting in a happier, more satisfied employment experience.(I would love to hear from people with more valuable experience and better ideas)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[CUBE and ROLLUP: Two Apache Pig Functions That Every Data Scientist Should Know · Joshua Lande]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/undefined/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/undefined/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2015 02:14:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CUBE and ROLLUP: Two Apache Pig Functions That Every Data Scientist Should Know · Joshua Lande&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guide to Building the Python Nest]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/guide-to-building-the-python-nest</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/guide-to-building-the-python-nest</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 00:25:49 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;No surprises in this post!

When I was working on a small product of my own last year and wanted everything to be perfect (one of the reasons why I could never ship it!) I remember spending a great deal of my time trying to figure out the best way to get the maximum information without annoying the user.If one is not the Facebook/Twitter of the world, people have the least amount of patience while signing up for a new service/product. One of the best ways to go about it is to stand on the shoulders of the giants and go with OAuth, letting them worry about information security while giving your users ‘one-touch-signup’. As it turns out, life is not always very simple. There are reasons why this may not be feasible for your product (maybe you are building another Facebook?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, cutting the long story short, the reason why I’m jumping up and down and going crazy and sitting down to write this post (while I have a few Pig scripts to complete before this lousy Monday ends) is because I found what I feel is one of the best solution to the signup problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack, has been a joy to use so far. With just this 2 field form I was able to signup (which is not uncommon these days)The friendly slackbot has been chatting me up and guiding me through things that are already quite intuitive. And, today it happened! The moment of extreme joy that brought tears of joy to my dark-circled, sleep deprived, over worked eyes. Lo-and-behold:After 4 days of using Slack, I get a ping from slackbot that walked me through giving details about my account that would make my profile more complete. No ugly form, no ugly “your profile is 40% complete” and most importantly, no long signup form. The experience was interactive and a joy to work.Of course this might not be possible for all products but, I’m sure that something similar would be part of the next thing that I start working on!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hadoop Installation Guide.]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/hadoop-installation-guide</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/hadoop-installation-guide</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2015 20:24:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is the third machine I’m setting up with a pseudo-hadoop cluster and each time I have to look up different tutorials to get everything right. High time I wrote it all down (neatly) in my own little corner of the Internet as a refresher for the next time I have to do the same (will try to create –and test– a shell script that makes that as simple as executing a script).
$ sudo addgroup hadoop$ sudo adduser hduser(provide password and other details)
Quite clearly not a mandatory step but it would help to keep the system wide things out of the way of hadoop. Also, this is a good way to simulate the production environment - with no root permissions, and elevated priviledges, etc.
$ su - hduser$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -P &quot;&quot;
Switch to the ‘hduser’ user and generate a public/private rsa key pair. Hadoop uses SSH to connect with other nodes, make sure to use no password while creating the key pair. Accept defaults to save the key at ~/.ssh/id&lt;em&gt;rsa 
Add the newly created key to the authorized&lt;/em&gt;keys:
$ cat ~/.ssh/id&lt;em&gt;rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized&lt;/em&gt;keys$ ssh localhost
Add ”localhost’ permanetly to the list of ”known_hosts’.
Download the latest stable release of Hadoop 2 (make sure that the ”hduser’ is in the list of sudoers or do these tasks by switching to another user and later give proper permissions to hduser):
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/hadoop2.6$ wget &lt;a href=&quot;http://mirrors.gigenet.com/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.0/hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz&quot;&gt;http://mirrors.gigenet.com/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.0/hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt; -P /opt/hadoop2.6$ cd /opt/hadoop2.6$ sudo tar xzf hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz
fileNow may be a good time to set a few environment variable so that we don’t have to type the entire path to use hadoop. Open your ~/.bashrc file and add these lines at the end (as indicated in this guide):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; HADOOP_PREFIX&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/opt/hadoop2.6/hadoop-2.6.0
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; HADOOP_HOME&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$HADOOP_PREFIX&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; HADOOP_COMMON_HOME&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$HADOOP_PREFIX&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; HADOOP_CONF_DIR&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$HADOOP_PREFIX&lt;/span&gt;/etc/hadoop
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; HADOOP_HDFS_HOME&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$HADOOP_PREFIX&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$HADOOP_PREFIX&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; HADOOP_YARN_HOME&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$HADOOP_PREFIX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, it’s time to tell hadoop which java to use. This is the only required configuration that you need to do according to the hadoop official documentation. Add the $JAVA&lt;em&gt;HOME to the $HADOOP&lt;/em&gt;HOME/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh file.
There are a bunch of configuration files under $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop and it is a good idea to understand what each of it does, not because you would be needing all of them in order to get started but, it might save you some time later when you are trying to figure out how, for instance, the replication factor can be changed for the cluster.
The important ones are -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot;&gt;# in the file core-site.xml

{% highlight python %}
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;dfs.replication&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

{% endhighlight %}
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time now to format the file-system:
$ $HADOOP&lt;em&gt;HOME/bin/hdfs namenode -format
We are nearly there! Start the deamons required for hadoop and create directories required to run M/R jobs:
$ HADOOP&lt;/em&gt;HOME/sbin/start-dfs.sh$ hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/hduser
This will start the ”NameNode’, ”DataNode’ and ”SecondaryNameNode’ on your pseudo-cluster. Use the utility ”jps’ to see if they are started properly.

The Utopian idea of privacy for citizens is a fantasy that’s going to die the most brutal death in the coming years.
Here are the reasons for the state/corporations to ’get to know your better’:
Terror ridden world that we live in - Terror attacks in Sydney, close to 150 school going kids brutally murdered in Pakistan, constant terror attacks and threats in almost every country are reasons enough for the state to urge the intelligence agencies to up their snooping efforts. Fear is an unreasonable ghost. This fear would motivate and justify surveillance efforts, spending, breach of privacy for the citizens.
Better utilization of resources - The state’s responsibility to provision resources to the citizens is often marred by a lethal supply-demand gap. The state’s excuse is that resources are wasted by those who demand it. Perishable resources like water, fuel need to be monitored at the source and at the households where they are consumed.
The corporations want to sell you more and more (as always) - The more they know about your spending habits, your likes/dislikes, your relationships and other dark secrets about you, the more business comes their way. Cross-selling, up-selling opportunities are too tempting to be ignored especially when finding those is as simple as capturing your browsing history and dishing out relevant ads!
Regressive nations want more control over their people - A state that has suppression, control as her guiding principles would want to know everything. And now, they can!
And how!
Pervasive devices - It is not difficult to imagine that EVERYTHING that you have on your body would be tagged in a few years time. It is not about paranoia but, about how simple this is to do. There are a bunch of startups in the IoT space that are already making devices that attach themselves to even the smallest of things that you own to make sure they are safe. Transport industry has been using the technology heavily. It would be neat if you were able to track your pets, kids, expensive items at home, etc.
Things we interact with everyday - The coffee dispenser knows your taste in coffee on a particular day, the social networks know the people you stalk, the car knows the deviations you took on a particular Friday while coming back from work!
Smarter homes, cities, work-spaces - Access control cards, privilege cards, bio-metric scanners!
IoT eco-system - And all of these devices interacting with each other, exchanging information, perfecting each other’s understanding of your world!
What changed in the last 2 decades:Technology keeps getting better. Believe in the Moore’s gospel or not, the fact is that technology keeps getting cheaper, faster and more pervasive. The days of “I’m sorry I missed your call, the phone was in the other room” have been replaced by the “I got the ‘blue ticks’ on your whatsapp!”. My mother who still does not feel comfortable sending me an email, sends me voice notes on Whatsapp on a regular basis. Avoiding technology is impossible! An ordinary phone today has more than 10 sensors, monitoring all your activities. An average human being carries at least one other device that captures some information (voluntarily or otherwise) and sends it to the cloud. 
Massive amounts of data is already being captured. Big data has been a buzzword for quite sometime; now, even the sluggish IT services giants in the third world countries are offering services around it. Predictive algorithms have a wealth of data to operate on, making them perform a lot better than before. 
There are no reasons to doubt that the state already knows you better than your wife!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How To Ride A Pig!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/how-to-ride-a-pig</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/how-to-ride-a-pig</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2014 01:19:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical about using PIG. I mean, why should I be using a (limited?) set of statements when I can actually do as much (and as little) as I want to do while writing MapReduce jobs with Java! To cut a long story short, I’m a fan of Pig now. It has it’s problems but for most problems that the world has to offer, it works like a charm.
When to use:If you google the phrase “When to use pig over MR” you would get a million perspectives/opinions. The best I found was this flow-chart (don’t remember the source, please point me to it if you can):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that we have the holy grail of all questions about Pig out of our way, let’s explore it a little bit.
InstallationThe installation guide walks you through the process. Personally, I found it exceptionally helpful to have the Pig plugin for eclipse (all it does is highlight my Pig Latin scripts but, even that is great help!) and write the code there. Writing the PigUnit test cases becomes easier then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sample Pig script&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple Pig script that does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load a file with structured data into an ‘alias’ (think of them as variables that store the schema of the file that is loaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pickup a few columns from this file and do some manipulation on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store the result into another file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;pig&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pig&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pig&quot;&gt;--These are single line comments!
--Load a file into an alias
sample_raw = LOAD &amp;#39;&amp;#39;input.txt&amp;#39;&amp;#39; AS     (name:chararray, age:int, doge_score:int, hipster_score:int) USING PigStorage(&amp;#39;&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;&amp;#39;) ;

--Do some manipulations
sample_man = FOREACH sample_raw GENERATE     name, (doge_score + hipster_score) AS total_score ;

--Store the results into a file
STORE sample_man INTO &amp;#39;&amp;#39;sample_man.csv&amp;#39;&amp;#39; USING PigStorage(&amp;#39;&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;&amp;#39;) ; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the script looks embarrassingly simple, a lot is happening under the hoods. Let’s start by defining some terminology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bag - Think of that as a table in the relational world. It is a collection of tuples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuples - These are the individual records that a ”Bag’ contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columns - The columns inside a tuple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important thing to consider is that Pig interpreter ultimately creates MR jobs and runs them. However, the MR jobs are run only for statements like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;STORE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;DUMP&lt;/code&gt;. Before that all that the script does is define schema for the file to be read and all manipulations are done using those schema. No file is read (however, if the file does not exist, your script will throw an exception).
So, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;LOAD&lt;/code&gt; statement defines a schema for the Bag and stores it into an ”alias’ &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sample_raw&lt;/code&gt;. The part of that statement in “( )” is not required but it is useful so that you can call your fields with names instead of using positional notation like “&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/code&gt;” etc.
The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FOREACH&lt;/code&gt; statement would run through all the Tuples and manipulate them for us (this is the part that carries the logic that you would otherwise write in a mapper). Important to remember that even here no MR job is actually run till the script encounters a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;STORE/DUMP&lt;/code&gt; statement.
Finally, the STORE statement would run a MR job and store the results into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sample_man&lt;/code&gt; directory (The results file should be something like “&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sample_man/part-m-00000&lt;/code&gt;”).
Easy! Let’s take a look at testing this script now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;PigUnit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PigUnit test framework is built on JUnit (yes, here you get to write some Java finally!) I would say that it is a work in progress because it comes with a lot of restrictions (as of version 0.13.0) but, it still works for most cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unit test strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I think is the best way to go about testing a Pig script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an input file with sample input (most examples show a String[] input/output, I think it defeats the purpose).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LOAD the input into the alias by using the PigTest.override() method and passing the same query used in the script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the output file to compare with the alias.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a piece of sample code for the above script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;List&lt;span class=&quot;token generics function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;String&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; outputList &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token generics function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;String&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
File outputFile &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;PATH_TO_TEST_OUTPUT_FILE&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
Scanner sc &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Scanner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;outputFile&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hasNext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    outputList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;nextLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
sc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
String&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; output &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
output &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; outputList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;output&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
test&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;assertOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;producer_raw&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; input&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;producer_clean&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; output&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The PigTest, sadly, has a bunch of flavors of assertOutput but, they are not perfect. There is a method to test an alias against a file but it does not let me assign input to another alias at the same time. The method used above expects the last argument to be a String[]. The PigTest.override() method only takes a query for the second parameter and there is not way to assign an input there to an alias.)
One major advantage of using this approach of testing is that your test scripts remain more or less generic. Just pass the appropriate test input file and a corresponding test output file and you can sit back and watch your pig grunt away to glory!

Be careful with “;” at the end of a %DECLARE statement. It might become a part of the variable that you are declaring!
DEFINE does verbatim substitution. This is just a lexical substitution, the execution of say a UDF DEFINEd in the script would happen only inside the FOREACH. This can lead to problems when you wish to generate a unique value for a column per-file that you process that remain constant for all the records in that file.
Scalar assignment works with %DECLARE
Pig/PigUnit works in two modes - local and MapReduce. By default it runs in MapReduce mode!
The parser is not very intuitive. Test the script with DESCRIBE alias ; if you run into problems.
Accessing tuples inside a bag can vary based on the context - Bag::field&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;tuple, Bag.field&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;tuple.
Avoid copy-paste of column names, etc. from a rich-text editor. One of the worst bugs I encountered were the ones where a freak character was copied by accident into my script! Again, the exceptions that you would get are not very intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Web n.what?]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/web-n-what</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/web-n-what</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2014 08:26:01 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A colleague at work asked me today, “Tell me what ‘Web2.0’ is”. It almost seemed like a historical question but, I ended up giving him the wrong answer! I remember “selling” 2.0 to a client a few years ago during a sales pitch however, things have changed tremendously in these few years.
I thought it is best that I write a short note to myself about the comparisons between 1.0, 2.0 and (what was initially touted as) 3.0 -versions- of the Web. Could be an interesting note to come back to, say, 5 years from now :)
Web 1.0 - The era of wide eyed audience!This was the static web age. HTML pages, poorly scattered all over the www. Schools felicitating their ”wiz-kids’ for hosting their High School’s info page on the Internet that was built using HTML and JPEG images. The bigger players were busy ”digitalising’ their content to make it available to the people over the Internet, the search engines were ingesting all of this static content and indexing, serving search results. Internet was all about discovery! The most dynamic nature of a typical website was a contact form that sent an email to the admin of the website!
Web 2.0 - The arrival of human beings.As good as the Internet was, being static was terrible! The community was there and it needed to connect more seamlessly. Web2.0 was already born before the term was coined! An age of interaction, user generated content, online social networking. The technology was nothing new but, the way it presented itself changed the way people connected, consumed and communicated over the www. The technology became a mere vehicle for content generation, a mechanism through with people could not only consume the web but also enrich it. Today a majority of content/data is user generated (or at least a result of user’s interaction with the web). The technology has expanded and become more reliable to handle this barrage of data!
Web 3.0 - The machines take over!Believe it or not, the machines have arrived! The technology today is more about several machines interacting with each other to improve the world around us. This is the age of APIs and IoT. According to a few estimates, in the next few years each human being in the world would be surrounded by &gt;3000 connected devices. If you do the math, the number can easily send your mind into a spin. A refrigerator ordering groceries from your local e-market when it is low on ammo, a self-driving car stopping for re-fuelling at a gas station, the bed giving notification to your local launderette to pick up the sheets when the dirt level goes beyond a mark and, all these interacting with your bank to carry out the monetary transaction is not just the future - it is here!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Do I Use Linux (and why you should too!)]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/why-do-i-use-linux-and-why-you-should-too</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/why-do-i-use-linux-and-why-you-should-too</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2014 21:30:58 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As much as all developers love Linux (and love Mac for the same reasons; things that Mac heavily borrows from BSD) there are several occasions when we are asked to justify our love. “Why should you use Linux and not Windows?” is mostly a question that has its origin in modern times, the era of IT services. 
I do not have the statistics with me (as yet) but my best guess is that most developers employed in IT services in India have Windows running on their machines. The PMs use Windows, the QC team uses Windows and Windows is thrust upon the developer, almost always without any alternative, for several reasons - ease of communication between the teams (myth), security (massive myth), etc.
This post is hopefully going to make more people adopt Linux based operating systems in the IT services industry (at least for developers). I’ve had the fortune to work in a product based start-up in my formative years as a developer (had a Linux box at college too because my old machine would just not run Windows!) and my current employers have been flexible enough to let my power-house of a system run on Linux power-fuel. Still, once in a while the question, “Why Linux?” is floated around. Here are the answers:
Development on Linux is easy I work with open-source technologies and using Linux makes harnessing the power of the whole ecosystem easy. For instance, I can install and experiment with Hadoop without the need to look for a virtual box to run it in, most articles that I find would be around Linux too!
Reduce your development timeWorking with Windows is frustrating, to say the least! The OS itself is slow and the utilities that it provides are just not enough for fast paced development. I’m sure someone who has been working on Windows for several years would be very fast/productive, no denying that but, if that same person moved to Linux the productivity would invariably increase. 
Security is not optional Linux is the most secure Operating System; it has always been. For anyone even remotely concerned about security (and everyone should be!) Linux should be a natural choice as a development platform.
The world is open-source; Open-source is a worldMost industry standards/technologies rely heavily on open-source. It is a smarter way to getting quality products with minimum investment. Being plugged in directly into this ecosystem negates the need for adapters and wrappers that a Windows user cannot live without. 
Helping a fellow developer is a normIn the open-source world, getting help is far more easier than in a closed system like Microsoft related technologies. The open-source culture is probably the first thing that encourages its use. I know that if I have a problem with a library that I’m using, I can connect with the developer who worked on it directly without having to raise a service ticket with a company and going through the horrors of explaining the issue to the support staff. You think a particular piece of code is a performance bottleneck? Shoot out a mail to the developer, email address is invariably in the comments on the code! If I’m on Linux too, it becomes easier for the person trying to help me.
Hacking a quick prototypeBefore you take on the task to write a 5000 line code to build RESTful web-services and deploy it to a web-server to show a prototype to the client, consider running a 10 line code on a node.js server (that you wrote yourself in under 5 minutes!)
“Look Ma, no dll”Linux is transparent! If something breaks, you can dig down and find out why. For a developer there is nothing more liberating than the fact that she has control over not just the code she’s writing but also on the infrastructure she is running it on! There is no magic happening under the hoods, everything is a configuration file that you can tweak to your liking.
The missing power tools!Linux has some very powerful tools that are simply not there in Windows! The terminal is a blazing fast, nuclear fusion powered, Rocky Balboa style powerhouse! and it packs some very powerful utilities. From text processing, to working with the Linux internals it has everything you need and much much more. 
The missing roads and burnt bridgesMicrosoft over the years has done very little to win back the developer community and the community has taken cognizance of that. Their insistence on IE (the worst browser of the world!), their continued effort to appear anti-open-source have all snowballed against them. Today, anyone worth their salt runs away from using Windows for any serious development. Some of the best web-servers of the world do not even run on Windows while IIS continues to be a scalability hazard. Powerful and standard tools like GIT are not available in Windows.
The realm of the cloudWith cloud computing transitioning from being a ‘buzz-word’ to a norm in the industry and, the entire cloud infrastructure running on Linux machines, Windows is eventually going to go away. At best, it would be limited to laptops that the management teams would use (which segment is again being threatened by Apple).
Reliability is king!Windows machines balk under pressure! As much as one tries to deny it, the blue screen of death is an inevitability for any Windows user. I don’t know about you but I would rather not lose my days effort to a blue screen of death right before I commit my code to an SVN server (The Flying Spaghetti Monster save you if the SVN server is running on Windows!)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[NoteToSelf >> Always keep your home machine updated!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/notetoself-always-keep-your-home-machine</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/notetoself-always-keep-your-home-machine</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2014 08:54:51 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I had been using my home Mac (which has become rather outdated now and painfully slow after Mavericks!) primarily for browsing, music and entertainment for a few months.

Go through this link to read more about the Downloader example. 
At the end of this step, you would have a HIB (HIPI Image Bundle) file, which is a collection (archive) of all the images that were downloaded. This step basically ensures that our MapReduce program gets a big file to work with which is what hadoop is meant to be dealing with.
Step 2: Image bundle as input to the mapper class that splits the HIB file into FloatImages that are the input to the map function of the mapper class. 
2a:I used OpenCv’s java bindings (available post version 2.4.9) to detect human faces in the images. This step would require you to convert the FloatImage to OpenCv’s Mat (which is essentially a matrix class with a header section detailing information about the image) - One of many Mat constructors takes a float[] that we can get from
FloatImage.getData()
Tip: The imageType produced from a float[] based constructor would be Cv&lt;em&gt;32FC3. Be sure to convert it to Cv&lt;/em&gt;8UC3 which is required by the next steps.
2b:I used the example on the OpenCv documentation page to do face detection. Here’s the relevant, slightly modified code:
sudo -s//Create a face detector from the cascade file in the resources directoryCascadeClassifier faceDetector = new CascadeClassifier(“lbpcascade&lt;em&gt;frontface.xml”);//Detect faces in the imageMatOfRect faceDetections = new MatOfRect();faceDetector.detectMultiScale(imageMat, faceDetections);
Step 3:The reducer is used simply to add the number of times faces are detected to give a total count (pretty silly, I know!)
Caveats and Tips:
Don’t forget to load the native OpenCv libraries before you start using them. For that you’d be required to place the lib files in the distributed cache and load them in the setup(Context c) method of the Mapper class so that they are available on each node of the cluster.
Create the Mat instance using proper type. Do required conversions.
The HIPI library might not work properly if you are on hadoop-2 (if you get an error similar to “Found interface but class expected” you are using a jar compiled with hadoop-1). I had to change a few of the hipi classes to get it to work. Will try to post the changes on my fork of hipi asap.
2a: Use image processing to add tags to the image.
2b: Pass the output of 2a through another mapper that makes ‘tag&lt;/em&gt;pairs’ (thus defining tags-correlation) and passes it to the reduce method.
([tag1, tag2],1)
Reducer
2c: The reducer will be able to predict a high-correlation between 2 (or, hopefully, more) tags based on the total number of times the same pair of tags are encountered in different images.Catch: The order of tags should not matter while adding up the counts.
Enhancement: The pair of tags can be input to another mapper/reducer for the same image by keeping on adding more tags to the pair, etc.
Step 3:Take an image as input and predict the associated tags.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[NGINX Tryout - ]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/nginx-tryout-live-blog</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/nginx-tryout-live-blog</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2014 21:55:46 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I will try to work out a basic installation of nginx to serve some static pages (with some javascript/angularJs magic) and hopefully get everything to work and without major problems. I shall document the steps and the issues here:
Some background: nginx (pronounced engine-x) is a web-server based on an event driven (asynchronous) architecture that scales fast and has amazing performance according to the &gt; 12% of the active sites that use it (some major names there like netflix, hulu, github, etc.).
Installation: I will try to install it on my Ubuntu 12.04 box. The default packages supplied by Cannonical are quite old. I’m using the info on this page to execute the following:
sudo -s
nginx=stable # use nginx=development for latest development version
add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/$nginx
apt-get update
apt-get install nginx
The installation gave no issues whatsoever. One surprise though - the server was started right after installation which wasted few minutes in trying to figure out why starting the server complained about the port being in use. The server executable would be in either of these locations: 
/usr/sbin/nginx or /usr/local/bin/nginx
Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost&quot;&gt;http://localhost&lt;/a&gt; and see a “It works!” page.
Configuration:
The first step is to edit your hosts file (on linux) to be able to set up more than one project on a single developer machine.Open /etc/hosts files with super user privileges and add your project’s domain name to the line that maps localhost to 127.0.0.1$ sudo vim /etc/hosts127.0.0.1 localhost example.dev
Copy the contents of your app to a convenient location, example:/var/www/example.dev/html 
$ sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites&lt;em&gt;available/default /etc/nginx/sites&lt;/em&gt;available/example.dev
Change the ‘server’ configuration for the above file. The items need to be edited are ”root’ (to start with). Point the ”root’ to the location of your websiteserver {    root /var/www/example.dev/html    index …}
Create a soft link in the sites&lt;em&gt;enabled directory:$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.dev /etc/nginx/sites&lt;/em&gt;enabled/
Restart your server:$ sudo service nginx restart&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dumb Users vs Bad UX!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/dumb-users-vs-bad-ux</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/dumb-users-vs-bad-ux</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2014 21:52:29 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Every web designer wants the end-users to be able to work their way around with ease on the platform that they have designed for them. That IS the primary goal of any interaction designer. Every other thing is a by product of providing that ease to the user - more sales, less support, more time with your boyfriend, etc.
It infuriates me when the the project stakeholders address the end-users as ‘dumb users’ while demonstrating why a certain design might not work out. The intelligence level of the user is no excuse for bad UX! The smartest of users would get lost in the jungle of bad user experience and the most naive user would be able to navigate with ease on a well designed and thought about website/app.
There are several guidelines and instruction manuals for creating that perfect UX (and you should read at least a few of them if you have any business with developing a website). Here’s my humble list of things that can, if nothing more, initiate a discussion on designing a UX that looks at intuitive and functional ways of providing a solution:
If you are simulating a process that exists in the real world (for example, an app that helps bring the processes involved in a government office onto the web), try to stay as close to the way the process is handled in the physical world as possible. There is nothing more painful than asking the end-user to change the way they’ve got used to doing a certain work. The app that you build should help them do what they already do much faster and in a less error prone way.
Forget point #1 above if you can bring a major improvement in the process in terms of time taken, infrastructure required or money spent! If the new process is an improvement, which was only possible due to the inclusion of technology, the time to learn to do things differently would be a trade-off that your customers would be happy with.
Use standard procedures as much as possible. If there is a need for a logout button, for instance, it must be placed at the top-right hand corner of the page. Why? Because everyone else does the same. When a user wants to logout that’s where she moves the cursor. These small factors can all give a major boost towards reducing the learning curve for the user when added up together.
If it is possible to shrink the target audience (reasonably), do that. If making your target audience smaller and more specific adds to improving the UX in a major way, that’s what you should be doing. For example, if your website caters to people who design circuit boards, give them icons that resemble the physical object as closely as possible. Innovation where it kills familiarity is a no-no.
Disclaimer: I’m not an interaction designer. I’ve worked on many web-applications however and have used several others and have seen the pain areas and beautiful implementations and, hence this article. Please feel free to add to it or correct me if I’m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Own Cute Little Web-Server (May The Node[JS] Be With You)]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/my-own-cute-little-web-server-may-the-nodejs-be</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/my-own-cute-little-web-server-may-the-nodejs-be</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2014 02:55:21 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have only recently started exploring NodeJS (I know terribly late it is!). This post can be considered a very basic introduction to NodeJS and its capabilities. And, judging from the topic of this post you should be convinced that the capabilities are massively impressive! Let’s dig in.
NodeJS is basically a runtime (utilizing Google’s V8 VM javascript runtime) and a bunch of libraries rolled into one awesome package that you can install with a simple:
$ apt-get install nodejs
Caution: There is a utility called ‘node’ in debian that might interfere with your node experience (you would not be able to execute nodeJS scripts with just:
$ node myAwesomeNodeScript.js
if it is installed already. There is a workaround however!)
The apt might have an old version of nodeJS. This might help you setup your system with the latest nodeJS and npm versions!
npm is the all powerful node package manager which (almost astonishingly strangely) manages the nodeJS packages on your machine.
Time for a quick test. In your favorite editor write this piece of code and save it in a file helloworld.js:
console.log(“Hello World!”);
From your terminal issue:
$ node helloworld.js
and you’ll see a brilliant shiny new “Hello World!” printed in solid gold for you on your terminal. Simple stuff. Now let’s move on to doing things that the article promised - building a web-server!
Open your favorite editor and type out the following lines in a file called httpServer.js and call it with node:
var http = require(“http”);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;function perRequest(request, response) {
{% highlight javascript %}
response.writeHead(200, {“Content-Type”:“text/plain”});
response.write(“Hello from nodeJS!”);
{% endhighlight %}
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http.createServer(perRequest).listen(8000);
console.log(“Server started. Listening on port 8000 …”);
Pretty much straight forward, self-explanatory piece of code. Let’s dig a little deep and see what nodeJS can and cannot do for us.
If you observe the above code, you’ll see that only a single instance of the server is created that is listening on the given port. On each request, the perRequest function is called but, the server does not wait for it to return in stead, it listens to other incoming requests and callback function operates behind the scenes to process each request. In a typical multi-threaded paradigm, the server would spawn a thread to handle the request, here things are different. NodeJS uses non-blocking, asynchronous I/O to process the request. 
If you were reading between the lines, you’d know that nodeJS is perfect for a fast I/O ecosystem. Typically, consider a check-in app like Foursquare (which uses NodeJS) built on top of a horizontal scale-able back-end like MongoDB (which again is a specialist in fast reads-writes) which could be handling millions of request but each request would not require any substantial processing. NodeJS is your best bet in such a scenario! Another typical use-case of nodeJS is a chat application.
If the use-case requires heavy processing, stick with a more traditional multi-threaded environments like JVM or better something like Erlang.
All modern apps are using nodeJS extensively and it makes sense to give it a good few weeks and see what it makes of you. No silver bullet to rid you of all your worries but, nodeJS is certainly worth a serious effort. May the node be with you!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valar Morghulis - A Shiny New World Of APIs]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/valar-morghulis-a-shiny-new-world-of-apis</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/valar-morghulis-a-shiny-new-world-of-apis</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2014 18:18:52 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world code would talk with code and do so seamlessly.  Sadly, as is the case with everything that man has built, APIs come in different shapes and sizes and getting them to talk with each other can sometimes be the major pain in your posterior.
The most common way of thinking of APIs/webservices today is going RESTful. It is common because it is efficient, simple and (if done well) can be an elegant way of opening up your system to the outside world.
I will try to list down a few best practices (as they are called) which are rather common sense checklist that one must keep in mind before venturing out to design an API:
Versioning - Even if you are making an API that only talks to your own front-end code hosted on the same box, it makes sense to have a version number for your API. Most frameworks that help you build quick and robust APIs already give a provision to include a version number, if the one you are using does not, make sure you do that extra bit of adding one to the endpoint url. It would make the life of clients interacting with your API a lot easier when something changes.The way you include is a matter of aesthetics! I personally like to have something of this sort:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.awesomeapp.com/v1/users&quot;&gt;http://api.awesomeapp.com/v1/users&lt;/a&gt;
You can include it as a query parameter as well, which brings us to the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean URL vs query parameters - Again, this is a matter of choice. No really! Ideally, let the juice of the request be clean and use query parameters for things like ‘offset’, etc.The ”juice of the request’ is the end-point name, version number of the API, etc.examples:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.awesomeapp.com/v1/users/id&quot;&gt;http://api.awesomeapp.com/v1/users/id&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.awesomeapp.com/v1/users?offset=1000&amp;#x26;fromId=1234&quot;&gt;http://api.awesomeapp.com/v1/users?offset=1000&amp;#x26;fromId=1234&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESTFul is old school (and it kicks ass) - REST is nothing new. It is not a new protocol,  just a new way of looking at API with old (experienced) eyes. REST is built on the good old http protocol. The basic idea is to use the http methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) along with an end-point (and throw in your common sense along).Here’s the common sense bit: Take GET for example for the resource ”users’. If the url points to a specific record (which is the case when, say, an ”id’ is appended at the end) return that record, otherwise return a list of records.
Returning lists - Not many systems would like to receive hundred thousand records when they query your API! Always use lazy-loading of objects and limit the number of records that are fetched together and sent back in the response. Use ”offset’, etc. in the query parameters to get the remaining set. (Streaming APIs are a different beast that we’ll kill in another episode)
HATEOAS is your best friend - I recommend that you visit that link and read more on HATEOAS! In short what it means is that when you send your response, let’s say, for a list of users, make sure that each user node in that list has a uri pointing to that particular user. Which brings us to the next point.
Data exchange - I would highly recommend using JSON as the format of data exchange between the server and the client. JSON format is clean, easily extendable and almost every language has great JSON parsers that make life easy for you. If you are using something like MongoDb as your database, the implementation becomes a piece of cake because Mongo uses BSON and in most cases all you’ll have to do is use the request and response interchangeably to communicate between the server and client.
Authentication - There are many options. The option that you should never opt is an API without authentication!!! I would suggest you to go for OAuth (there are different versions - look for a future post on this site for which one to use or go read the rfc notes). It is the recommended way of authentication for web-services and there are tons of libraries that you can use to create your own OAuth provider.
Don’t be a snobbish web-service - Be good to the client! Do proper error handling and always return proper (documented) error messages/codes in the same format that success responses go. For example, don’t throw a 404 HTTP error code response, have an error code inside your 200 response that tells the client that the request failed, etc. Include URIs to help documentation in the error response or at the least give detailed error messages.
Good to haves - Here are a few things that are good to bundle with your API implementation. They go well with the point number 8 above:Build a test client that let’s your users experiment on a test data set.
Have an API schema entry point. This should list out all entry points of the API (think of this as the top level of a perfect HATEOAS implementation)
Design the APIs in such a way that even when the implementation behind the scenes changes, the API end-points remain the same (this is in fact one of the most important thing to consider in API design!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I’ll try to keep expanding this list, while trying to keep it short. Think of this as a ”notes-to-self’ post so I’ll come back and add links to resources and share more refined knowledge as I learn more. Do comment with your suggestions.]&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Duplicate Form Submissions - The Tale Of The Button That Got Clicked Twice!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/duplicate-form-submission-the-tale-double-click</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/duplicate-form-submission-the-tale-double-click</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2014 18:17:28 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the old saying goes -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a button, the user will click it. If the button can be clicked twice, they would click it twice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate data due to multiple submissions of the same form can be disturbing (or alarming, depending on what your application does!). There are primarily two approaches to solve the problem - handling it on the server side, avoiding multiple submissions from the client side - and I would say implement both of them!
(I encountered a solution on a forum that says “Best solution: Educate your users to the problems with multiple submits”  .This is not just a herculean task but just plain right against principles of good usability - if you are not convinced, read the quote at the top of this page!)
Let’s see what our options are:
Disable the button with javascript after user clicks it once - Fairly simple to do. Just make sure that once the user has clicked the button once your submit function disables the button first and then sends the request to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;someButton.disabled =&amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot;;
someForm.submit()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would work only when you are using a separate function to submit the form. A common gotcha is to disable the button on click/submit and then expecting the form to submit on its own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disable the button with jQuery - jQuery is king (or queen?)! This would probably be the best way to resolve the multiple form submission problem on the client side. jQuery provides a function called .one() that binds a handler to the selector which is executed only once. What .one() essentially does is that it uses .on() to bind your function and then calls &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$(this).off(event)&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that the selected element does not respond to the same event again.So you could do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$(&amp;#39;&amp;#39;#myForm&amp;#39;&amp;#39;).one(&amp;#39;&amp;#39;submit&amp;#39;&amp;#39;,function(){&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you use ‘submit’ and not ”click’ so that the form cannot be submitted even by other means and not just by clicking on the submit button.Note that this would take care of scenarios of handing validation errors on client side as well (for server side validation errors spilling on the the page after form submission you’ll have to tinker with the script depending on whether it is a page reload or an asynchronous call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Grails there’s the withForm token - Grails provides a simple way to handle multiple form submission issue. Use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;useToken=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; tag on your form and add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;withForm{}&lt;/code&gt; method in your controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;g:form useToken=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; ...&amp;gt;

withForm {
 // good request
}.invalidToken {
 // bad request
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach relies on both client and server side&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flask’s awesomeness - If you are a python guy and use flask to solve problems of the world, you have already solved this one. I’m assuming that you are using WTForms to render your forms, in that case all that is required is that you use a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{{form.hidden_tag()}}&lt;/code&gt; inside your form element in your template and put the save logic inside a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;form.validate_on_submit()&lt;/code&gt;: method. Simple and efficient with a lot of pythony goodness!
Handling it in the server - I would say, do this in addition to any client side approach! There are two ways I can think of doing this (please suggest flaws with these approaches or something better in the comments section).Use a (logged&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;user + record + timestamp + reasonable&lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;diff) to decide if the record is an undesired duplicate or not.
Use a randomly generated token with every rendering of a form to decide if the request is coming from the same rendered form by multiple clicks or if the token is different then go ahead with the saving mechanism. This method is less error prone and efficient in implementation and use and if you design your system intelligently, it would not require every developer to ensure that she takes the multiple form submit issue in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tryst With IE10!]]></title><link>https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/tryst-with-ie10</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://prasoonj.github.io/snortingcode/posts/tryst-with-ie10</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2014 18:16:16 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We recently hit upon a weird bug. Few of our jQuery grids (rendered via the default jQuery plugin, available in Grails using &amp;#x3C;jqgrid: /&gt;) stopped loading in IE10 (please don’t say anything, we’re already sore about taking a decision to support it) when we deployed the application on the cloud (S2). Some custom functions that were used to format the grid data became undefined, even when we could see them in the page’s source code.
After a lot of investigation (and several misleading guesses that each required time and effort to code-deploy-test because on our local machines everything worked fine anyways!) we figured out that the problem was the way IE loaded and executed the javascript libraries.
Ideally, when you include javascript libraries to your webpages in a particular order, you’d expect them to be loaded (and executed) in the same order. However, there’s a tradeoff when it comes to serially loading the libraries and executing them in order as a particularly heavy library may obstruct the loading of other smaller ones which would essentially delay rendering of a fully functional page.
The ideal order of page loading should be:
Load the DOM elements.
Parallely load mutually exclusive js libraries.
Load libraries that are dependencies for other libraries/scripts.
Load the dependent libraries.
(assuming that the execution would follow similar usage pattern)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, in our case, cropped up when a dependent js library started executing even before the library it required (jquery-min-1.8.x) was still loading over the slow test server on the cloud. Notably, this happened only on IE10!
Ironically, IE was the first browser to introduce ’defer’ to give some sort of a manual control over the loading of javascript libraries. It has been a long journey since the days of defer. HTML5 has some cool strategies to deal with this issue (which are not fully supported by all browsers atm I believe).
The fix
We tried quite a few things to fix this issue. Since the project is built on Groovy on Grails, we explored the idocyncracies of the &amp;#x3C;r:script tag as well [It does not do an in-place substitution of the enclosed scripts, it attaches the script before the end of the &lt;/body&gt; tag. Could be quite troublesome in trying to trace an unsuspected bug I guess] but could not achieve much. Finally, all we did was to make sure that the page loading performance is improved so that we cut down the latency that was being introduced by the cloud deployment. A thorough examination and elimination of unwanted scripts got the things to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
