Watching a dog wag its tail is right up there with "getting schifty" as one of the best experiences life has to offer. There's something so genuine about a dog wagging its tail that melting of tough hearts is a low error prediction! In fact, the word "genuine" does not correctly describe what's going on in here. When you smile at your dog, that smile is genuine because you had an option to be disingenuous. In the dogs case, there is no "genuine wagging tail" because it lacks the ability to NOT wag it when it is happy or wag it to deceive you into a trap formulated by dogs that became *self-aware as a result of modifications that they made to their cognition amplifier*.

"A happy dog wags its tail" then, is not much of a consequence of something but a mere identifying characteristic of the dog. Which means that if you were sitting blindfolded in front of an unknown animal and you were to ask just one question to correctly identify if the animal is a dog or not, you could ask "Does it wag its tail if you pet it?" (Of course, if the animal is a lion the experimenter is unlikely to test out the question proposed by actually trying it out. Let's see what I mean by that:
To be able to answer the question "Does it wag its tail if you pet it?", I should either pet the lion and see if it wags its tail, or I should have had this experiment data from some place else (which I'm unlikely to have).
In that case, the experimenter would have to either say "Yes" without any reasonable explanation or they could say "No" by accepting "pet to induce tail-wagging" as a characteristic unique to the category of dogs.)

With that background, consider how funny a statement like, "Bob genuinely has a nose" is! Yes, not all people have noses but, for a staggering majority, noses are a common feature of being a human being. Notice how in the dogs case the identifying characteristic is an action while in the human example, the characteristic is an physical property. In both cases, however, they are an innate quality that tells us something unique (or otherwise) about the category of humans or dogs.

When a dog wags its tail, it does so quite naturally without being "aware" of it. I mean, sure the dog is aware that the tail is wagging, it can feel it, even see it if its a big bushy one but, it is not aware of it just like we are not aware of our nose.  We can be aware of our actions, selves, etc.
