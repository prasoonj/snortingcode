I write this post with mixed feelings. While I would consider myself successful in keeping social media out of my life in the last few months, I do have to admit that Lord FOMO has not been very kind to me. Add to that the fact that the Internet has BECOME the social media to a certain extent. It is important, then, to not just ignore its presence and opt-out like I did, but to take charge and strengthen the resistance that's daring to surface to provide alternative ways for people to connect.

Young people are breaking up with Facebook, we know that now. But, most of this churn is unlikely to be due to any of the read issues with it:
- Addiction
- Concent manufacturing (misinformation propagation that makes people take irrational decisions)
- Advertising (which is a more specific form of the above)

This fact is evident in that most of these young people are clinging to other platforms like Whatsapp, Snapchat and Instagram which are only slightly better than the giant social media company. Indeed most are owned by the same people.
