Salespersons ruin everything! Adding to their long list of spoils is the phrase “Are you interested?”. If you’ve ever had a person call you about a bank loan, credit card or a new insurance policy, you know what I’m talking about. I remember when the phrase “Are you interested?” was used to express deep, emotional relationships. “I’m in love with you. Are you interested in me?”, “We are going for a trek next Sunday, are you interested?”There was a purpose about that phrase. Being interested in something was just that - being genuinely interested in it. Now, thanks to the cold calling of salespersons (and that “Interested” button on Facebook events), it is just an euphemism for “Have I got your attention?”.

Now, those two are very different things. A dog wagging his tail gets my attention almost always! That does not mean that I’m ready for a commitment, a relationship with him no matter how cute I find him (and dogs, truly are awesome!)“Have I got your attention”, to most people, feels too superficial for some reason.I recently connected 2 of my contacts over a phone call for a business venture. My motive to get this relationship going was to have the pleasure of seeing a business flourish, observe how small businesses interact with their customers and, use that learning for my own startup. The response after this introduction was - “Yes, I’m interested!” (possibly without the “!”). I was quite happy with my efforts, hoping to make a difference in someone’s life when I heard that. If they are interested, they would make things work! However, this turned out to be one of those “You’ve got my attention” cases. Fizzled out in a few days!

Well, here’s what I do: If I’m interested, I make an effort to get things rolling. I call, message, reach out, talk, break walls, build bridges. If I’m not, I say, “Sorry, that does not interest me” and I stop right there. If an idea is not interesting enough to be worth a dream, I don’t keep it dangling in my brain. There are always much better things to look forward to. I’m not a great judge of ideas TBH. I’ve missed out on a lot of great opportunities that would have been great ventures I’m sure. But, I don’t think I remember many that I chased with all my energy and was disappointed about my effort. That for me is something I would live with - an honest effort or an honest denial.The most crucial thing to learn for me right now is to identify people who mean it when they say, “I’m interested!”
