Hate it or hate it a lot, state surveillance is going to expand into the unthinkable realm; the state snoopers are going to get inside your house, under your skin. The Utopian idea of privacy for citizens is a fantasy that’s going to die the most brutal death in the coming years.
Here are the reasons for the state/corporations to ’get to know your better’:

Terror ridden world that we live in - Terror attacks in Sydney, close to 150 school going kids brutally murdered in Pakistan, constant terror attacks and threats in almost every country are reasons enough for the state to urge the intelligence agencies to up their snooping efforts. Fear is an unreasonable ghost. This fear would motivate and justify surveillance efforts, spending, breach of privacy for the citizens.

Better utilization of resources - The state’s responsibility to provision resources to the citizens is often marred by a lethal supply-demand gap. The state’s excuse is that resources are wasted by those who demand it. Perishable resources like water, fuel need to be monitored at the source and at the households where they are consumed.

The corporations want to sell you more and more (as always) - The more they know about your spending habits, your likes/dislikes, your relationships and other dark secrets about you, the more business comes their way. Cross-selling, up-selling opportunities are too tempting to be ignored especially when finding those is as simple as capturing your browsing history and dishing out relevant ads!

Regressive nations want more control over their people - A state that has suppression, control as her guiding principles would want to know everything. And now, they can!
And how!

Pervasive devices - It is not difficult to imagine that EVERYTHING that you have on your body would be tagged in a few years time. It is not about paranoia but, about how simple this is to do. There are a bunch of startups in the IoT space that are already making devices that attach themselves to even the smallest of things that you own to make sure they are safe. Transport industry has been using the technology heavily. It would be neat if you were able to track your pets, kids, expensive items at home, etc.
Things we interact with everyday - The coffee dispenser knows your taste in coffee on a particular day, the social networks know the people you stalk, the car knows the deviations you took on a particular Friday while coming back from work!
Smarter homes, cities, work-spaces - Access control cards, privilege cards, bio-metric scanners!
IoT eco-system - And all of these devices interacting with each other, exchanging information, perfecting each other’s understanding of your world!
What changed in the last 2 decades:Technology keeps getting better. Believe in the Moore’s gospel or not, the fact is that technology keeps getting cheaper, faster and more pervasive. The days of “I’m sorry I missed your call, the phone was in the other room” have been replaced by the “I got the ‘blue ticks’ on your whatsapp!”. My mother who still does not feel comfortable sending me an email, sends me voice notes on Whatsapp on a regular basis. Avoiding technology is impossible! An ordinary phone today has more than 10 sensors, monitoring all your activities. An average human being carries at least one other device that captures some information (voluntarily or otherwise) and sends it to the cloud. 
Massive amounts of data is already being captured. Big data has been a buzzword for quite sometime; now, even the sluggish IT services giants in the third world countries are offering services around it. Predictive algorithms have a wealth of data to operate on, making them perform a lot better than before. 
There are no reasons to doubt that the state already knows you better than your wife!
