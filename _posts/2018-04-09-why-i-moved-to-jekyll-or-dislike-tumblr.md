>TL;DR; Writing on Tumblr is slow!

I've been in love with the content I consume on Tumblr. I think it's quirky, imaginative and delicious. Tumblr has been able to create a niche for itself in the several content areas and I would rather spend my time on Tumblr than say, Facebook (the dark underbelly of Tumblr is quite exciting as well!)

That said, I don't enjoy composing my posts on Tumblr. It is a slow and painful process, even when I use the markdown editor.

# Here's what I would have liked to have on Tumblr:

* Auto save! I've lost some work once in a while because Tumblr does not save what you write automatically. Switching from `Post` mode to `Save` mode is just insane!
* The *Preview* is a lot of times very different from what I finally see on the browser.
* A better way to search my posts and organise them.
* Ability to create a collection of posts on a topic. Think of this as a "Series". I don't have a direct way of doing this on Jekyll either but, it is a lot faster to update multiple posts on my editor.

# Things I love about Jekyll

* I can use my own editor! Atom works very well with markdown templates and I know the shortcuts!
* I can preview on localhost. This is just incredible faster, especially when you are writing something that has a lot of different types of content - code blocks, etc.
* More creative control over the look and feel of my blog (although, this is just initial excitement. I'm yet to change anytime in this template I picked up from Github)
* Hosting at Github is wonderful! There might be some scale issues but hey, this is not a mission critical application!
