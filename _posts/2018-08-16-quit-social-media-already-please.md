I’ve spent countless wasteful hours on content that “provides motivation” to do the right thing. Spiritual gurus, sports psychologists, industry leaders, youtube philosophers thrown into the mix, churned into a goop of indistinguishable spaghetti of thoughts.

Before I can talk about that waste, I must qualify what “the right thing” to do might be. I believe that everyone has a perfectly tuned, innate moral compass that does not require any political, legal or religious frame of reference to decide the best investment of their time. Then, as we come across different power structures and our place within them, we draw arbitrary lines of moral code of conduct for ourselves. The arbitrariness of these lines that “should never be crossed” is evident in the fact that when we are dealing with ‘the other’, the topology of this moral navigation changes considerably! In fact, even for our own self, these moral high-grounds provide an opportunistically shifting grazing, often under the charming deception of the tutelage provided by the authority figures who we look up to for inspiration and moral conduct. So, while it might be difficult to articulate what it is, one always knows what the right course of action must be.

We are constantly trapped in a myriad of unescapable, spiralling, perpetual miseries. One such spiral is comfort. Feed comfort and it expands its appetite till you end up dead from the burden of the curse of the task of maximising the comfort in your life. Sit in a chair for an hour and your body would scream when you touch the floor. For most of us, a descent from higher moral standards is more comfortable than the climb for reasons that are so human in their origin that they can’t be negated by lectures in courage and motivation, whatever the framework and medium of delivery might be.

I’ve considered myself a social media addict for a long time now, even though my consumption/participation has been well below the average lately, I believe. I can only imagine the hardships that are upon other sufferers. Take an online test to know where you are in your addiction. Then there are other impacts of making a deal with the devil when we use these platforms for free. The debate about Facebook using our data to manipulate our social, economic and political consent happening on Facebook is as laughable and ineffective as therapy for alcohol addiction served along with a gin and tonic. 

For these reasons, I’ve wanted to control my urge to be on social media platforms for a while now. While blanket motivation or spiritual initiation might work for others, they don’t really work very well for me. I’m replacing those with some good old overdose of rational thought. I came across an advertisement for a “Survey for cash”-esque mobile phone app called “Applause” which claims to be “Crowdsourced Software Testing Platform” and the fine print for this particular project reads:

> By installing this software, you’re giving us (Facebook) permission to collect data from your phone that would … You are also letting us collect information about your internet browsing activity (including the websites you visit and data that is exchanged between your device and those websites) and your use of other online services. There are some instances when we will collect this information even where the app uses encryption, or from within secure browser sessions.”

Since I can’t fight rational thought, I freed my life from Instagram, the only social media app surviving on my phone, today. I feel very peaceful.
