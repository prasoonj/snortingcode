algorhythmn:

Yesterday my lab partner and I needed to do an assignment for today. He was working so I told him I could do the assignment alone (it was so short), and he asked me if I think I was able to do all the work. I was really offended because it was just describe an algorithm. It’s not difficult at all. :/ And when I finish the assignment and he saw it, he changed almost everything I did. Actually it was the same I wrote but he changed the words. Anyway, today we explain to the class what we had done and guess who was the only one who talked? Everytime I wanted to explain something, he interrupted me. So I barely talked. I don’t like to talk in public but today I felt very confident and that pissed me off so much.

Can’t help but compare this with what happens in the industry as well. More power to women who code please!
