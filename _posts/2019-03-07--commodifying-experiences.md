Mcleodganj (Dharamshala) is a small town tucked away in the western part of Himachal Pradesh, India. The primary attraction of Mcleodganj is the buddhist monastry that attracts thousands of people each year. In the freezing fag-end of winters, His Holiness The Dalai Lama visits the town to impart bhuddhist teachings which transforms this tiny town into a gushing river of devotees and curious people like me. This late February event also marks the beginning of the *tourist season*. The hibernating vibrance of the town springs out of the colorful shops near the main square, local businesses invoke their Gods as they begin to welcome the tourists from all over the world.

The average foreign tourist begins their **Great Indian Adventure** typically in New Delhi, the Indian capital and, a sizable chunk make their way to the mountains, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand providing a window into the Indian culture and way of life; a gentle and peaceful introduction to India. It is common for these tourists to share their share of *horror stories* from Delhi. Even just a few hours are enough to shock them into a reality that few would understand from a Bollywood blockbuster.
