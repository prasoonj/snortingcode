Pedro Alves on Business Intelligence: Setting up WebEx on Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bits)Iâ€™ve had major issues trying to get WebEx to work on my linux box. And for some reason the corporate world insists that an old applet based technology be used in the moder world to establish communication and collaboration.I tried few hacks listed on different forums but, never got to understand what really is going on till I launched firefox from my terminal and dug into the error logs. Used that information to land on this page which explains what is happening and how to fix it.Thank you Internet and your affectionate people.
