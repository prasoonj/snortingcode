I had been using my home Mac (which has become rather outdated now and painfully slow after Mavericks!) primarily for browsing, music and entertainment for a few months. The presence of a monster linux box at work did not help the situation and I’ve been lazy to even clean up space and organise my folders.
Today, I had to do some quick fixes for a project from home and that’s when it hit me - brew won’t work, XCode is outdated, maven is MISSING (yes, thanks to Mavericks!). So, here I am, writing this note while XCode downloads are in progress :(
