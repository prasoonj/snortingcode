The Sierra upgrade had not been very kind on my old laptop, an early 2011 MacBook Pro. It came with an i5 Intel processor but just 4 GB of RAM (and the fact that it has a 320 GB SATA disk didn’t help the cause for a machine that could actually be used for anything productive at all). RAM upgrade was the obvious first choice after viewing the results from vm_stat (that’s vmstat on the Mac terminal) that were showing a very high number of Pageouts - meaning that the RAM was not enough to store all the pages of memory required by the OS and applications which made the OS swap out existing pages into the secondary memory (it being SATA killed speed).So yeah, long story short, I upgraded to 16 GB (against the guidelines provided by Apple on this issue for my generation of laptop) and I can see 0 pageout and a visibly fast machine. I can switch between open projects in Eclipse and GarageBand, listen to music while editing this post. Might not sound like much to ya’ll but, to me it is close to discovering inter-dimensional space travel portal gun in this age of mediocre earth transportation.Next saving goes into investing on an SSD storage. I wonder if I can get rid of the monstrous Optical Drive and have an SSD instead. Would make my laptop a lot lighter and lightening fast!
