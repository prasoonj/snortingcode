Many of the greatest inventions and discoveries of the human race have been the result of a process with at least 3 categories of progressive steps: 

1. Being puzzled by something that seems obvious.
2. Attempting to control it. 
3. Gaining a deeper understanding.

Let's take a couple of examples to show you what I mean. We could begin with `fire`! It is safe to assume that our species saw wild fire and unlike other animals didn't just get afraid and run away, they probably stayed around the billowing jungle fire that was engulfing their homes to take notes. Then they began to experiment with it to see if they could control it - they would see that they could make it bigger or contain it, they would see that they could take it with them! Then must have begun the age of a deeper understanding (we never really grow out of that last phase).

Take another example - electricity! The observational wealth of knowldege around electricity (and magnetisim!) dates back to at least the ancient greeks. The first published work by William Gilbert in the 1600 happens to be a giant catalog of this knowlege about electricity up till that time. Then comes along Benjamin Franklin and puts a noose around this wild, untamable natural phenomenon and *keys into the thunderstorm* for some *run o'the mill electricity*. He also talks about the ability to *store* electricity. That's when we start controlling electricity. Maxwell then becomes the person to initiate the **deeper understanding** phase of electricity. 

>This has been the success formula for millions of years.

> **Observe => Control => Understand**

But, every once in a while, we reach a stage where tried and tested methodologies fail. Not because the methodology has fallacies but simply because the nature of the problem is remarkably different from what we've been dealing with so far. I hope to present one such problem in this post. 

Let's look at the most pressing issue of our times. Something that the world's consciousness has never faced before - end of organised life on earth because of climate change. The world is facing a crisis at the moment which is much bigger than any other issue being discussed in popular forums across the planet. We've been misbehaving with the environment of this planet and it is starting to show alarming signs of it choaking at an unpresidented rate. 

Let's look at the response that us, earth dwellers and, the only culprits have been able to collectively muster so far:
- Climate Change denial is **still a thing!**.
- There is no agreement on the deadlines set by the IPCC by the most powerful/capable.
- There's renewable energy talk without the required quanta of action and policies in most places on the planet.
- There's a rather big camp of the **"we've always survived catastrophic events in the past"** people.
- Equally alarming size of the **"God is taking revenge for Gay marriages"** people.
- A rather tiny but significant camp of the super rich who are, honestly, too old now to give a shit about you and I having a *bad weather* (to be read in the voice of one of the greatest philanthropist of our times - Bill Gates).

The situation in the response department is, as if, we are hoping to find a way to **control the environment** by inventing a gadget in a Silicon Valley garage (invested in and marketed by your friendly, neighbourhood venture capitalist. The company tagline - *"Give us your money and you'll still be breathing in our digital closet long after the earth is smoked out!"*)

You see, this particular problem does not fit our age old `Observe => Control => Understand` paradigm. This one here is a candidate for a different problem solving approach. We need to gain better understanding before we can attempt to control it. And this is such a complex beast that developing an understanding could take a while. Possibly even longer than the T0 (assimilation into the Singularity event!) And till that time comes, we need to appreciate what we have and hold on to it for at least a little longer. We can't just blow up this earth and venture out into the space looking for other places to build a home, inspite of what Hollywood and Elon Musk might have you believe!

Well, in closing and, to answer the question about some smart science grad student "solving" climate change in the near future, I must tell you that they have solutions that could work just no magic wand as yet!
