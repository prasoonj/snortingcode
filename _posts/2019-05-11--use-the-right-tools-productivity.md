At [QAMRA (Queer Archiving for Memory, Reflection asd Activism)](https://qamra.in), we use [Matrix](https://matrix.org) for communication, ...

There are several measures of complexity, some more precise than others. One method of visualizing complexity that I find very convenient when explaining the idea in a broad sense to people without a technical background, is to define it as:

> “Complexity is directly proportional to the number of concepts one has to keep in one's active memory to get a task done.”

I think I heard it in a talk on Elm-lang. If we use this definition of complexity, the more comprehensive our model of the world, the more complex it becomes.

Two aspects of organizational demands in managing complexity are:

1. Handling communication (between agents, regarding the task)
2. Task management (scheduling, prioritizing, deligating)
